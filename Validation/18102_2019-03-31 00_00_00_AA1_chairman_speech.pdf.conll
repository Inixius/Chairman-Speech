The _ O

Over _ O

the _ O

are _ O
soon _ O

India _ O

be _ O
a _ O

; _ O
more _ O
than _ O
50% _ O

the _ O

. _ O

I _ O
call _ O
this _ O
a _ O
Tsunami _ O
. _ O

In _ O
our _ O
experience _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
realized _ O
that _ O
early _ O
detection _ O
is _ O
important _ O
and _ O
NCDs _ O
can _ O
be _ O
prevented _ O
or _ O
reversed _ O
. _ O

But _ O
we _ O
need _ O
to _ O
take _ O
good _ O
care _ O
of _ O
our _ O
precious _ O
bodies _ O
. _ O

At _ O
Apollo _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
made _ O
it _ O
our _ O
Mission _ O
to _ O
carry _ O
the _ O
message _ O
of _ O
prevention _ O
and _ O
early _ O
detection _ O
countrywide _ O
and _ O
overseas _ O
also _ O
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
regard _ O
we _ O
have _ O
launched _ O
ProHealth _ O
, _ O
a _ O
three-year _ O
health _ B-key
and _ I-key
wellness _ I-key
programme _ I-key
for _ O
our _ O
60,000 _ O
plus _ O
members _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Apollo _ O

and _ O
their _ O
dependents _ O
, _ O
a _ O
total _ O
of _ O
200,000 _ O
people _ O
. _ O

The _ O
programme _ O
facilitates _ O
early _ O
detection _ O

healthy _ O
living _ O
through _ O

On _ O
completion _ O
of _ O
the _ O

, _ O
I _ O
  _ O
plan _ O
to _ O
send _ O
each _ O
one _ O
a _ O
cake _ O
to _ O
celebrate _ O
their _ O
health _ O

I _ O
  _ O
urge _ O
captains _ O
of _ O

to _ O
extend _ O
this _ O
beneficial _ O

all _ O

I _ O
firmly _ O
believe _ O
when _ O

takes _ O
the _ O

follow _ O
