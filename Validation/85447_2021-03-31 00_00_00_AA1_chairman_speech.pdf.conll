Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O

The _ O
COVID _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
pandemic _ O
has _ O
touched _ O
every _ O
aspect _ O
of _ O
our _ O
lives _ O
across _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

It _ O
has _ O
altered _ O
mindsets _ O
, _ O
perceptions _ O
, _ O
and _ O
strategies _ B-key
for _ O
businesses _ O
and _ O
beyond _ O
. _ O

If _ O
there _ O
is _ O
one _ O
abiding _ O
lesson _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
that _ O
sustainable _ O
growth _ O
and _ O
development _ O
involves _ O
holistic _ O
nurturing _ O
of _ O
human _ O
, _ O
natural _ O
, _ O
and _ O
financial _ B-key
capital _ I-key
. _ O
2020 _ O
is _ O
a _ O
year _ O
that _ O
will _ O
only _ O
gain _ O
in _ O
significance _ O
when _ O
viewed _ O
through _ O
the _ O

The _ O
Global _ B-key
Economy _ I-key
The _ O
world _ O
has _ O
been _ O
fighting _ O
the _ O
Covid _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
pandemic _ O
for _ O
more _ O
than _ O
a _ O
year _ O
now _ O
, _ O
and _ O
the _ O
struggle _ O
has _ O
had _ O
deleterious _ O
economic _ B-key
effects _ O
. _ O

In _ O
2020 _ O
, _ O
the _ O
global _ O
economy _ O
contracted _ O
by _ O
3.3% _ O
, _ O
the _ O
largest _ O
contraction _ O
on _ O
record _ O
, _ O
at _ O
least _ O
since _ O
World _ O
War _ O
II _ O
. _ O

Much _ O
of _ O
it _ O
was _ O
concentrated _ O
in _ O
the _ O
first _ O
half _ O
of _ O
our _ O
fiscal _ O
year _ O
FY21 _ O
, _ O
as _ O
several _ O

enforced _ O
strict _ O

Economies _ B-key
bounced _ O
back _ O
– _ O

at _ O

on _ O
the _ O

, _ O

in _ O
the _ O

after _ O

( _ O

the _ O

expected _ O
to _ O
record _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
recovery _ O
in _ O
2021 _ O
, _ O
resulting _ O
in _ O
a _ O
net _ O
positive _ O
expansion _ O
of _ O
their _ O
economies _ B-key
over _ O
the _ O
2019 _ O
levels _ O
. _ O

These _ O
two _ O
engines _ O
of _ O
growth _ O
are _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
boost _ O
demand _ B-key
for _ O

from _ O

Even _ O
the _ O
other _ O
two _ O
large _ O
economies _ B-key
, _ O
the _ O
EU _ O
and _ O

, _ O
are _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
expand _ O
. _ O

In _ O
response _ O
to _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ O
, _ O
central _ O

resorted _ O
to _ O
strongly _ O
supportive _ O
monetary _ B-key
policies _ I-key
in _ O
most _ O

go _ O
down _ O
to _ O

At _ O
the _ O

time _ O
, _ O
another _ O
consequence _ O
of _ O
this _ O
