The _ O

marked _ O
by _ O
economic _ B-key

socio-political _ O
uncertainty _ O

Emerging _ O

grappling _ O
with _ O
tougher _ O
conditions _ O

given _ O

The _ O

has _ O
, _ O
in _ O

This _ O

The _ O
Indian _ O

Over _ O
the _ O

the _ O

performance _ O
in _ O
the _ O

We _ O
delivered _ O
a _ O
reasonably _ O
good _ O
performance _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
across _ O
all _ O
our _ O
geographies _ O
, _ O
despite _ O
macroeconomic _ B-key
challenges _ O
. _ O

In _ O
India _ O
, _ O
we _ O
recorded _ O
industry _ O
leading _ O
volume _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
business _ O
in _ O
Indonesia _ O
navigated _ O
the _ O
slowdown _ O
well _ O
. _ O

We _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
scale _ O
up _ O
our _ O
presence _ O
in _ O
Africa _ O
. _ O

In _ O
Latin _ O
America _ O
and _ O
the _ O
UK _ O
too _ O
, _ O
we _ O
performed _ O
strongly _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
profit _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
particular _ O
, _ O
has _ O
been _ O
robust _ O
. _ O

While _ O
this _ O
was _ O
undoubtedly _ O
aided _ O
by _ O
lower _ O
raw _ O
material _ O
costs _ B-key
, _ O
it _ O
was _ O
also _ O
due _ O
to _ O
the _ O
good _ O
work _ O
that _ O
our _ O
teams _ O
have _ O
done _ O
in _ O
improving _ O
gross _ B-key
margins _ I-key
. _ O

Gross _ O
margins _ O
increased _ O
by _ O
440 _ O
basis _ O
points _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
600 _ O
basis _ O
points _ O
in _ O
Indonesia _ O
and _ O
370 _ O
basis _ O
points _ O
for _ O
our _ O
overall _ O
business _ O
. _ O

But _ O
beyond _ O
the _ O
numbers _ O
- _ O
and _ O
this _ O
is _ O
what _ O
makes _ O
me _ O
proud _ O
- _ O
our _ O
performance _ O
reflects _ O
a _ O
great _ O
deal _ O
of _ O
resilience _ O
, _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
how _ O
we _ O
adapt _ O
to _ O
and _ O
capitalise _ O
on _ O
changes _ O
in _ O
the _ O

This _ O
will _ O
hold _ O
us _ O
in _ O
very _ O
good _ O
stead _ O
in _ O

last _ O

. _ O

What _ O
is _ O
your _ O
take _ O
on _ O
that _ O
? _ O

As _ O
I _ O
see _ O
it _ O
, _ O
stock _ B-key
performance _ O
is _ O
ultimately _ O
, _ O
an _ O
outcome _ O
. _ O

If _ O
you _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
the _ O
right _ O
areas _ O
and _ O
deliver _ O
, _ O
the _ O
market _ B-key
will _ O
reward _ O
you _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
stock _ B-key
performance _ O
is _ O
a _ O
good _ O
validation _ O
of _ O
both _ O
our _ O
business _ O
performance _ O
and _ O
consistent _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
value _ B-key
creation _ O
. _ O

It _ O
also _ O
shows _ O
the _ O
confidence _ O
that _ O

their _ O
high _ O
expectations _ O
, _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O

value _ B-key
creation _ O

So _ O
, _ O
it _ O
energises _ O
us _ O
to _ O
work _ O
harder _ O
to _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
meet _ O
the _ O

This _ O

been _ O
a _ O

While _ O
there _ O
are _ O
some _ O

that _ O
we _ O
can _ O
definitely _ O
take _ O
away _ O
, _ O
there _ O
are _ O
also _ O
some _ O

. _ O

Some _ O
of _ O
the _ O

that _ O
we _ O
had _ O
launched _ O
a _ O

Some _ O
of _ O
our _ O

The _ O

is _ O
that _ O
we _ O

To _ O
that _ O

from _ O

As _ O
we _ O

it _ O
is _ O
important _ O
for _ O

adding _ O
a _ O

This _ O
is _ O
a _ O
very _ O
underserved _ O
market _ B-key
and _ O
provides _ O
significant _ O
opportunities _ O
for _ O
us _ O

So _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
extending _ O
our _ O
focus _ O
from _ O

for _ O

in _ O

is _ O
that _ O

that _ O

our _ O
strategy _ B-key
and _ O
where _ O
we _ O

, _ O
we _ O
continue _ O
to _ O

We _ O
don _ O

The _ O
market _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
is _ O
at _ O
the _ O
forefront _ O
of _ O
innovation _ B-key
for _ O
these _ O

for _ O

They _ O
are _ O
constantly _ O
innovating _ O
and _ O
have _ O
a _ O
robust _ O
portfolio _ O
of _ O
heritage _ O
, _ O
category _ O
leading _ O
hair _ O
care _ O
brands _ O

So _ O
, _ O
this _ O
acquisition _ O
enables _ O
us _ O
to _ O
address _ O
the _ O
complete _ O

needs _ O
of _ O

What _ O
makes _ O
GCPL _ O
an _ O

of _ O
choice _ O
? _ O

For _ O
us _ O
, _ O
being _ O
an _ O
employer _ O
of _ O
choice _ O
is _ O
a _ O
very _ O
important _ O
part _ O
of _ O
our _ O
overall _ O
ambition _ O
of _ O
being _ O
a _ O
leading _ O
global _ O
FMCG _ O

We _ O
want _ O
to _ O
be _ O
able _ O
to _ O

team _ O
members _ O
, _ O
who _ O
are _ O
inspired _ O
to _ O
give _ O
their _ O
best _ O
at _ O

So _ O
, _ O
we _ O
take _ O
much _ O
pride _ O
in _ O
creating _ O
a _ O
supportive _ O
, _ O
enabling _ O
work _ O
environment _ O
with _ O
stretch _ O

to _ O

great _ O

We _ O

Some _ O
people _ O
have _ O
expressed _ O
concerns _ O
on _ O
your _ O
ROCE _ O
. _ O

What _ O
is _ O
your _ O
take _ O
on _ O
that _ O
? _ O

Clearly _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
very _ O
cognisant _ O
of _ O
this _ O
. _ O

Given _ O
that _ O
one _ O
of _ O
our _ O
most _ O
important _ O
focus _ O
metrics _ O
is _ O
EVA _ O
, _ O
ROCE _ O
is _ O
important _ O
for _ O
us _ O
. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
three _ O
years _ O
, _ O
ROCE _ O
has _ O
gone _ O
up _ O
by _ O
340 _ O
basis _ O
points _ O
. _ O

If _ O
you _ O
look _ O
at _ O
operating _ O
ROCE _ O
versus _ O
reported _ O
ROCE _ O
, _ O
our _ O
operating _ O
ROCE _ O
has _ O
been _ O
very _ O
healthy _ O
( _ O
60 _ O
per _ O
cent _ O
plus _ O
) _ O
, _ O
while _ O
reported _ O
ROCE _ O
has _ O
been _ O
lower _ O
due _ O
to _ O
the _ O
goodwill _ O
sitting _ O
on _ O
the _ O
books _ O
from _ O
acquisitions _ O
. _ O

Lower _ O
reported _ O
ROCE _ O
is _ O
a _ O
consequence _ O
of _ O
the _ O
stage _ O
of _ O
growth _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
and _ O
our _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
an _ O
inorganic-supported _ O
strategy _ B-key
. _ O

At _ O
this _ O
stage _ O
, _ O
we _ O
need _ O
to _ O
take _ O
a _ O
call _ O
between _ O
accelerating _ O
revenues _ B-key
and _ O
profits _ B-key
or _ O
just _ O
maximising _ O
ROCE _ O
. _ O

But _ O
in _ O
emerging _ O
markets _ O
, _ O
given _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
potential _ O
, _ O
focusing _ O
on _ O
gaining _ O
scale _ O
and _ O
accelerating _ O
profits _ B-key
is _ O
equally _ O
important _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
not _ O
just _ O
about _ O
maximising _ O
ROCE _ O
. _ O

Having _ O
said _ O
that _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
very _ O
conscious _ O
of _ O
improving _ O
our _ O
ROCE _ O
. _ O

As _ O
we _ O
gain _ O
more _ O
scale _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
focusing _ O
very _ O
hard _ O
on _ O
improving _ O
profit _ B-key
margins _ O
and _ O
working _ O
capital _ B-key
. _ O

This _ O
will _ O
lead _ O
to _ O
improved _ O
ROCE _ O
. _ O

What _ O
could _ O
you _ O
have _ O
done _ O
better _ O
last _ O
year _ O
? _ O

There _ O
are _ O
a _ O
couple _ O
of _ O
areas _ O
that _ O
I _ O
can _ O
think _ O
of _ O
, _ O
where _ O
we _ O
could _ O
have _ O
possibly _ O
done _ O
better _ O
last _ O
year _ O
. _ O

We _ O
should _ O
have _ O
managed _ O
our _ O
overheads _ O
more _ O
tightly _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
innovation _ B-key
front _ O
, _ O
our _ O
pace _ O
of _ O
timely _ O
new _ O
launches _ O
could _ O
have _ O
been _ O
better _ O
. _ O

I _ O
also _ O
wish _ O
the _ O
macroeconomic _ B-key
environment _ O
had _ O
supported _ O
more _ O
robust _ O
sales _ B-key
growth _ O
. _ O

The _ O
good _ O
thing _ O
, _ O
however _ O
, _ O
is _ O
that _ O
our _ O
company _ O
is _ O
stronger _ O
than _ O
ever _ O
before _ O
and _ O
we _ O
have _ O
learned _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
. _ O

So _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
a _ O
very _ O
good _ O
position _ O
to _ O
deliver _ O
a _ O
stronger _ O
performance _ O
in _ O
the _ O
year _ O
ahead _ O
. _ O

What _ O
are _ O
your _ O
key _ O
priorities _ O
this _ O
year _ O
