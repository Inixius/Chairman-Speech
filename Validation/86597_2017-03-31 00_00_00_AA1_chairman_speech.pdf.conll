The _ O
great _ O
Indian _ O
story _ O
represents _ O
a _ O
beacon _ O
of _ O
hope _ O
. _ O

The _ O
accelerated _ O
pace _ O
of _ O
economic _ B-key
reforms _ O
in _ O
India _ O
is _ O
possibly _ O
the _ O
fastest _ O
across _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

The _ O
size _ O
, _ O
speed _ O
and _ O
implications _ O
of _ O
the _ O
structural _ O
shifts _ O
could _ O
not _ O
have _ O
been _ O
contemplated _ O
even _ O
as _ O
recently _ O
as _ O
a _ O
few _ O
years _ O
ago _ O
. _ O

With _ O
reference _ O
to _ O
the _ O
giant _ O
strides _ O
made _ O
, _ O
India _ O
has _ O
demonstrated _ O
creditable _ O
resilience _ O
in _ O
the _ O
most _ O
challenging _ O
of _ O
times _ O
for _ O
the _ O
global _ B-key
economy _ I-key
in _ O
recent _ O
history _ O
. _ O

India _ O
, _ O
in _ O
fact _ O
, _ O
is _ O
the _ O
finest _ O
asset _ O
class _ O
across _ O
the _ O
globe _ O
today _ O
. _ O

This _ O
resilience _ O
has _ O
meant _ O
that _ O
India _ O
reported _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
7.1 _ O
per _ O
cent _ O
during _ O
the _ O
last _ O
financial _ B-key
year _ I-key
, _ O
an _ O
honourable _ O
headline _ O
concurring _ O
with _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
most _ O
dramatic _ O
macroeconomic _ B-key
shifts _ O
: _ O
an _ O
attempt _ O
to _ O
formalise _ O
a _ O
largely _ O
unorganised _ B-key
economy _ I-key
into _ O
an _ O
organised _ O
one _ O
following _ O
currency _ B-key
demonetisation _ B-key
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
era _ O
of _ O
open _ O
economies _ O
, _ O
robust _ O
ports _ O
have _ O
a _ O
critical _ O
role _ O
in _ O
driving _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

The _ O
ports _ B-key
sector _ I-key
facilitates _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
interaction _ O
with _ O
the _ O
world _ O
; _ O
it _ O
provides _ O
a _ O
gateway _ O
of _ O
products _ B-key
into _ O
and _ O
out _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
. _ O

At _ O
Adani _ O
Ports _ O
, _ O
we _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
ports _ O
need _ O
to _ O
play _ O
a _ O
bigger _ O
role _ O
than _ O
just _ O
providing _ O
physical _ O
infrastructure _ O
; _ O
they _ O
need _ O
to _ O
help _ O
moderate _ O

costs _ I-key
from _ O
6 _ O

10% _ O
of _ O

At _ O
Adani _ O
Ports _ O
, _ O
the _ O
business _ O
may _ O
be _ O
ports _ O
but _ O
the _ O
story _ O
is _ O
quintessentially _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Adani _ O
Ports _ O
was _ O
conceived _ O
around _ O
a _ O
singular _ O
idea _ O
: _ O
a _ O
solutions _ O
- _ O
driven _ O
organization _ O
rather _ O
than _ O
merely _ O
of _ O
passive _ O
infrastructure _ O
. _ O

This _ O
differentiation _ O
has _ O
had _ O
across-the _ O
- _ O
business _ O
implications _ O
: _ O
Adani _ O
Ports _ O
is _ O
not _ O
engaged _ O
in _ O
business _ O
with _ O
the _ O
singular _ O
objective _ O
to _ O
capture _ O
market _ B-key
share _ I-key
; _ O
the _ O
company _ O
is _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
the _ O
prospect _ O
of _ O
expanding _ O
the _ O
market _ B-key
. _ O

Adani _ O
Ports _ O
is _ O
not _ O
a _ O
single-location _ O
infrastructure _ B-key
firm _ I-key
; _ O
the _ O
company _ O
is _ O
a _ O
multi-location _ O
complement _ O
of _ O
ten _ O

driven _ O
by _ O
the _ O
vision _ O
of _ O
shifting _ O
the _ O
world _ O

gravity _ O
towards _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Adani _ O
Ports _ O

not _ O
merely _ O
invested _ B-key
in _ O

; _ O
the _ O

has _ O
invested _ B-key
in _ O
a _ O
platform _ O
that _ O
provides _ O
global _ O
and _ O
Indian _ O
companies _ O
an _ O
opportunity _ O
to _ O
profitably _ B-key
grow _ O
their _ O
businesses _ O
. _ O

Adani _ O
Ports _ O
does _ O
more _ O
than _ O
what _ O
a _ O
normal _ O
port _ O
would _ O
engage _ O
in _ O
; _ O
the _ O
company _ O
has _ O
progressively _ O
diversified _ O

across _ O

east _ O
, _ O
west _ O
and _ O

I _ O
proudly _ O
observe _ O
that _ O
Adani _ O

translated _ O
this _ O
vision _ O
into _ O
