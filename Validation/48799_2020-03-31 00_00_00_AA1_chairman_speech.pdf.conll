Importance _ O
of _ O
Coal _ O
and _ O
Coal _ O
India _ O
Limited _ O
Coal _ O
is _ O
our _ O
country's _ O
irreplaceable _ O
prime _ O
energy _ O
source _ O
. _ O

Coal _ O
is _ O
at _ O
the _ O
forefront _ O
of _ O
the _ O
nation's _ O
energy _ O
march _ O
in _ O
meeting _ O
the _ O
demand _ B-key
. _ O

Notwithstanding _ O
the _ O
projections _ O
over _ O
renewables _ O
displacing _ O
coal _ O
, _ O
it _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
dominate _ O
India's _ O
electricity _ O
generation _ O
for _ O
few _ O
more _ O
decades _ O
. _ O

Additionally _ O
, _ O
coal _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
stoke _ O
up _ O
many _ O
non-power _ O
industries _ O
as _ O
well _ O
viz _ O
. _ O
cement _ O
, _ O
fertilizers _ O
, _ O
sponge _ O
iron _ O
, _ O
aluminium _ O
and _ O
a _ O
host _ O
of _ O
other _ O
industries _ O
. _ O

In _ O
India _ O
, _ O
coal _ O
accounts _ O
for _ O
around _ O
55% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country's _ O
primary _ O
commercial _ O
energy _ O
. _ O

Nearly _ O
72% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
entire _ O
power _ O
generated _ O
in _ O
the _ O
country _ O
is _ O
coal _ O
based _ O
, _ O
which _ O
is _ O
a _ O
testimony _ O
to _ O
the _ O
importance _ O
of _ O
coal _ O
. _ O

Admittedly _ O
, _ O
a _ O
conscious _ O
impetus _ O
is _ O
laid _ O
on _ O
alternative _ O
clean _ O
and _ O
renewable _ B-key
energy _ I-key
sources _ I-key
, _ O
especially _ O
solar _ O
. _ O

India _ O
targets _ O
to _ O
add _ O
175 _ O
GW _ O
of _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
capacity _ O
by _ O
2022 _ O
and _ O
275 _ O
GW _ O
by _ O
2027 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
country _ O
is _ O
however _ O
aiming _ O
for _ O
an _ O
ambitious _ O
RE _ O
target _ O
of _ O
275 _ O
GW _ O
by _ O
2027 _ O
. _ O

This _ O
move _ O
is _ O
in _ O
accordance _ O
with _ O
the _ O
Intended _ O
Nationally _ O
Determined _ O
Contribution _ O
( _ O
INDC _ O
) _ O
of _ O
the _ O
nations _ O
as _ O
committed _ O
in _ O
Paris _ O
during _ O
COP _ O
- _ O
21 _ O
. _ O

World _ O
over _ O
, _ O
many _ O
countries _ O
are _ O
migrating _ O
from _ O
coal _ O
to _ O
cleaner _ O
forms _ O
of _ O
renewable _ B-key
energy _ I-key
sources _ I-key
but _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
the _ O
situation _ O
is _ O
different _ O
. _ O

The _ O
question _ O
is _ O
can _ O
renewables _ O
take _ O
over _ O
coal _ O
completely _ O
in _ O
our _ O
country _ O
? _ O

Not _ O
in _ O
the _ O
near _ O
future _ O
at _ O
least _ O
. _ O

Solar _ O
, _ O
Wind _ O
, _ O
Hydel _ O
and _ O
natural _ O
gas _ O
supplement _ O
coal _ O
in _ O
meeting _ O
energy _ O
needs _ O
but _ O
cannot _ O
substitute _ O
wholly _ O
. _ O

For _ O
the _ O
past _ O
couple _ O
of _ O
years _ O
, _ O
India _ O
accounted _ O
for _ O
around _ O
11% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
global _ O
coal _ O
consumption _ O
. _ O

India _ O
remains _ O
the _ O
second _ O
largest _ O
coal _ O
consumer _ O
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

With _ O
Coal _ O
holding _ O
such _ O
a _ O
large _ O
sway _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
energy _ B-key
sector _ I-key
, _ O
your _ O
company _ O
produces _ O
around _ O
83% _ O
of _ O
nation's _ O
entire _ O
coal _ O
output _ O
. _ O

During _ O
2019 _ O
- _ O
20 _ O
, _ O
around _ O
80% _ O
of _ O
the _ O

entire _ O

was _ O
catered _ O
to _ O

Importantly _ O
, _ O
Coal _ O
India _ O
ascertained _ O
that _ O
as _ O
on _ O
1st _ O
April _ O
2020 _ O
there _ O
was _ O

in _ O
critical _ O
or _ O
super _ O
critical _ O
condition _ O
for _ O

of _ O

In _ O
fact _ O
, _ O
the _ O

are _ O
still _ O

to _ O
the _ O
mandated _ O
required _ O

Renewables _ O
and _ O
coal _ O
have _ O
to _ O
co-exist _ O
for _ O
some _ O
time _ O
before _ O

significantly _ O
contribute _ O

At _ O
some _ O
point _ O

in _ O

this _ O
is _ O
bound _ O
to _ O
