Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
During _ O
FY22 _ O
the _ O
employees _ O
of _ O
Titan _ O
Company _ O
once _ O
again _ O
rose _ O
to _ O
the _ O
occasion _ O
, _ O
overcame _ O
the _ O
challenges _ O
and _ O
delivered _ O
exceptional _ O
customer _ O
delight _ O
and _ O
sales _ O
and _ O
financial _ O
growth _ B-key
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
they _ O
were _ O
joined _ O
by _ O
the _ O
larger _ O
Titan _ O
Family _ O
members _ O
: _ O
all _ O
our _ O
franchisees _ O
, _ O
distributors _ O
, _ O
retailers _ O
and _ O
vendor _ O
partners _ O
and _ O
their _ O
employees _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
all _ O

working _ O
at _ O
our _ O
various _ O
facilities _ O
on _ O
the _ O
rolls _ O
of _ O
our _ O

organisations _ O
. _ O

I _ O
would _ O

my _ O
sincere _ O

on _ O

of _ O
the _ O
Company _ O

Titan _ O
who _ O
have _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
support _ O
us _ O
even _ O
during _ O
times _ O
like _ O
these _ O
when _ O
their _ O
own _ O
needs _ O
for _ O
our _ O
products _ O
were _ O
not _ O
that _ O
pressing _ O
. _ O

The _ O
future _ O
looks _ O
really _ O
bright _ O
for _ O
Titan _ O
Company _ O
: _ O
• _ O
As _ O
Indians _ O
inexorably _ O
march _ O
towards _ O
the _ O
USD _ O
5000 _ O
per _ O
capita _ O
GDP _ O
, _ O
their _ O
desire _ O
for _ O
lifestyle _ O
products _ O
will _ O
explode _ O
• _ O
Our _ O
low _ O
market _ O
share _ O
in _ O
many _ O
of _ O
our _ O
categories _ O
combined _ O
with _ O
the _ O
increasing _ O
affinity _ O
for _ O
Trust _ O
will _ O
accelerate _ O
this _ O
further _ O
• _ O
Our _ O
deep _ O
penetration _ O
of _ O
Tier _ O
3 _ O
, _ O
4 _ O
and _ O
5 _ O
towns _ O
will _ O
unlock _ O
the _ O
real _ O
potential _ O
in _ O
small _ O
towns _ O
and _ O
establish _ O
our _ O
leadership _ O
in _ O
each _ O
of _ O
those _ O
markets _ O
very _ O
early _ O
• _ O
Our _ O
Digital _ O
maturity _ O
will _ O
propel _ O
us _ O
and _ O
help _ O
us _ O
maintain _ O
the _ O
momentum _ O
• _ O
The _ O
relationship _ O
that _ O
our _ O
store _ O
staff _ O
share _ O
with _ O
millions _ O
of _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
will _ O
bring _ O
all _ O
this _ O
alive _ O
in _ O
a _ O
manner _ O
unique _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
consumer _ O
space _ O
Assessment _ O
done _ O
in _ O
quarter _ O
3 _ O
of _ O
FY22 _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
Board _ O
was _ O
adjudged _ O
the _ O
Best _ O
Large _ O
Cap _ O
Board _ O
by _ O
an _ O
eminent _ O
jury _ O
, _ O
leaping _ O
over _ O
much _ O
larger _ O
and _ O
older _ O
companies _ O
. _ O

I _ O
must _ O
thank _ O
all _ O
the _ O
Directors _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
, _ O
past _ O
and _ O
present _ O
, _ O
for _ O
building _ O
an _ O
environment _ O
and _ O
processes _ O
that _ O
helped _ O
achieve _ O
this _ O
. _ O

I _ O
must _ O
also _ O
thank _ O
all _ O
our _ O
shareholders _ O
for _ O
the _ O
continued _ O
belief _ O
and _ O
support _ O
. _ O

FY22 _ O
began _ O
on _ O
an _ O
uncertain _ O
note _ O
with _ O
the _ O
second _ O
wave _ O
. _ O

The _ O
third _ O
wave _ O
in _ O
January _ O
2022 _ O
and _ O
the _ O
global _ O
conflict _ O
in _ O
February _ O
2022 _ O
aggravated _ O
the _ O
situation _ O
further _ O
and _ O
made _ O
for _ O
a _ O
truncated _ O
financial _ O
year _ O
. _ O

But _ O
the _ O
whole _ O
Titan _ O
family _ O
rose _ O
to _ O
the _ O
occasion _ O
once _ O
again _ O
and _ O
delivered _ O
stupendous _ O
results _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Management _ O
of _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
best _ O
Tata _ O
and _ O
Titan _ O
tradition _ O
, _ O
put _ O
this _ O
family _ O
in _ O
the _ O
centre _ O
of _ O
everything _ O
it _ O
did _ O
, _ O
reconfirming _ O
the _ O
tenet _ O
that _ O
We _ O
Must _ O
Not _ O
Just _ O
Grow _ O
, _ O
but _ O
We _ O
Must _ O
Grow _ O
Responsibly _ O
. _ O

Like _ O
I _ O
had _ O
expressed _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
Being _ O
Good _ O
is _ O
Good _ O
for _ O
Business _ O

I _ O
must _ O
share _ O
with _ O
you _ O
that _ O
the _ O
sense _ O
of _ O
Destiny _ O
across _ O
the _ O
Titan _ O
Company _ O
system _ O
is _ O
palpable _ B-key
, _ O
almost _ O
visceral _ B-key
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
gunning _ O
for _ O
a _ O
big _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
every _ O
category _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
. _ O

And _ O
especially _ O
so _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Indian _ B-key
Ethnic _ I-key
Wear _ I-key
, _ O
Fine _ B-key
Fragrances _ I-key
and _ O
Women _ B-key
’ _ I-key
s _ I-key
Bags _ I-key
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
also _ O
ratcheting _ O
up _ O
our _ O
thrust _ O
behind _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
Diaspora _ O
opportunity _ O
for _ O
Jewellery _ B-key
. _ O

The _ O
Tanishq _ B-key
Flag _ I-key
will _ O
soon _ O
fly _ O
in _ O
multiple _ O
locations _ O
in _ O
West _ O
Asia _ O
and _ O
North _ O
America _ O
. _ O

Equally _ O
, _ O
our _ O
ambitions _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Technology _ O
Products _ O
space _ O
are _ O
also _ O
surging _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
made _ O
huge _ O
inroads _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Wearables _ B-key
category _ I-key
in _ O
the _ O
last _ O
six _ O
months _ O
with _ O
very _ O
exciting _ O
products _ O
under _ O
the _ O
Titan _ O

Fastrack _ O
names _ O
and _ O
are _ O
becoming _ O
a _ O
player _ O
to _ O
watch _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
sure _ O
by _ O
end _ O
FY23 _ O
we _ O
will _ O
become _ O
a _ O
prominent _ O
name _ O
in _ O
this _ O
category _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Titan _ B-key
EYEX _ I-key
is _ O
a _ O
smart _ O
Eyecare _ O
product _ O
that _ O
has _ O
made _ O

in _ O

fabulous _ O
innovation _ O
( _ O

) _ O
and _ O
exceptional _ O
value _ O

I _ O
am _ O
sure _ O
we _ O
will _ O
build _ O
on _ O
this _ O
