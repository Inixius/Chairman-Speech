, _ O
one _ O
of _ O

While _ O
this _ O
is _ O
no _ O
surprise _ O
given _ O
that _ O
pandemics _ B-key
like _ O
the _ O
Asian _ B-key
Flu _ I-key
of _ O
1957 _ O
spread _ O
through _ O
trade _ O
and _ O
travel _ O

, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
obvious _ O
that _ O
the _ O
world _ O
was _ O
just _ O
not _ O
prepared _ O
for _ O
the _ O
explosive _ O

This _ O
has _ O
exposed _ O
several _ O
of _ O
the _ O
fragilities _ O
of _ O
global _ O
interdependence _ O
that _ O
will _ O
need _ O
to _ O
be _ O
fixed _ O
and _ O
each _ O
country _ O
is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
do _ O
it _ O
differently _ O
. _ O

Curiously _ O
though _ O
, _ O
the _ O
remedy _ O
for _ O
this _ O
malady _ O
is _ O
coming _ O
through _ O
the _ O
process _ O
of _ O
globalisation _ O
, _ O
as _ O
evidenced _ O
by _ O
the _ O
worldwide _ O
collaboration _ O

Therefore _ O
, _ O
paradoxically _ O
, _ O
both _ O
the _ O
problem _ O

its _ O
solution _ O
lie _ O

the _ O

manage _ O

that _ O

better _ O

that _ O

However _ O
, _ O
as _ O

we _ O
see _ O

criticised _ O
repeatedly _ O
for _ O
not _ O
doing _ O
enough _ O
to _ O
protect _ O
its _ O
own _ O

Sometimes _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
worth _ O
keeping _ O
in _ O
mind _ O
that _ O
India _ O
has _ O
more _ O
people _ O

the _ O

In _ O

words _ O
, _ O
our _ O
country _ O
is _ O
facing _ O
a _ O
challenge _ O
bigger _ O
than _ O
what _ O
three _ O
continents _ O
are _ O
facing _ O
at _ O
a _ O
time _ O
when _ O
every _ O

maximising _ O
what _ O
it _ O
can _ O
do _ O
for _ O
its _ O

has _ O

better _ O
healthcare _ O

built _ O
over _ O
several _ O
decades _ O
. _ O

Given _ O
that _ O
our _ O
vaccination _ O
effort _ O
is _ O
bigger _ O
than _ O
the _ O
combined _ O
efforts _ O
of _ O
87 _ O
countries _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
only _ O
fair _ O
to _ O
take _ O
a _ O

the _ O

In _ O
this _ O

I _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Atmanirbharta _ O

by _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
is _ O
a _ O
transformational _ O

COVID _ B-key

has _ O
demonstrated _ O
, _ O
to _ O
most _ O
nations _ O
across _ O

world _ O
, _ O
that _ O

be _ O
at _ O
the _ O
cost _ B-key

We _ O
must _ O
believe _ O
in _ O
our _ O

must _ O
be _ O

the _ O

our _ O

From _ O

two _ O
things _ O

With _ O

driving _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O

. _ O

It _ O
was _ O
at _ O

that _ O
I _ O
decided _ O
we _ O
must _ O
align _ O
with _ O
our _ O
nation _ O
’ _ O

On _ O
the _ O
22nd _ O

I _ O
penned _ O
down _ O
my _ O

We _ O
moved _ O
fast _ O

Thereafter _ O
, _ O
in _ O
Q3 _ O

in _ O

§ _ O
Simultaneously _ O
, _ O
we _ O
formed _ O
game-changing _ O

the _ O

full _ O
four _ O

This _ O
is _ O
what _ O

the _ O
Adani _ O
Foundation _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
primary _ O
focus _ O
over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
year _ O
was _ O
guided _ O
by _ O
the _ O
battle _ O
against _ O
COVID _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
. _ O

One _ O
of _ O
the _ O
issues _ O
the _ O
cascading _ O
nature _ O
of _ O
this _ O
pandemic _ B-key
thrust _ O
into _ O
the _ O
national _ O
spotlight _ O
was _ O
the _ O
grave _ O
inequality _ O
across _ O
our _ O
scattered _ O
communes _ O
in _ O
access _ O
to _ O
relief _ O
and _ O
care _ O
. _ O

As _ O
soon _ O
as _ O
the _ O
virus _ O
took _ O
hold _ O
, _ O
we _ O
mapped _ O
out _ O
the _ O
urgencies _ O
of _ O
the _ O
moment _ O
and _ O
studied _ O
how _ O
best _ O
we _ O
could _ O
mitigate _ O
distress _ O
across _ O
India _ O
. _ O

We _ O
quickly _ O
realised _ O
that _ O
the _ O
battle _ O
needed _ O
more _ O
than _ O
the _ O
standard _ O
assortment _ O
of _ O
medical _ O
items _ O
, _ O
like _ O
protective _ O
gear _ O
and _ O
diagnostic _ O
kits _ O
. _ O

The _ O
most _ O
pressing _ O
need _ O
was _ O
for _ O
additional _ O
means _ O
to _ O
quickly _ O
deliver _ O
medical _ O
oxygen _ O
across _ O
the _ O
land _ O
. _ O

The _ O
solution _ O
was _ O
tied _ O
to _ O
several _ O
items _ O
that _ O
were _ O
in _ O
short _ O
supply _ O
locally _ O
. _ O

We _ O
needed _ O
more _ O
cryogenic _ O
tanks _ O
capable _ O
of _ O
transporting _ O
oxygen _ O
in _ O
supercooled _ O
liquid _ O
form _ O
, _ O
more _ O
medical _ O
oxygen _ O
cylinders _ O
for _ O
hospitalised _ O
patients _ O
, _ O
more _ O
oxygen _ O
generator _ O
plants _ O
for _ O
healthcare _ O
facilities _ O
unable _ O
to _ O
rely _ O
on _ O
transported _ O
supplies _ O
and _ O
more _ O
oxygen _ O
concentrators _ O
for _ O
people _ O
managing _ O
their _ O
infection _ O
by _ O
themselves _ O
. _ O

It _ O
was _ O
a _ O
formidable _ O
challenge _ O
but _ O
one _ O
that _ O
we _ O
rose _ O
to _ O
, _ O
quickly _ O
and _ O
efficiently _ O
. _ O

Working _ O
with _ O
our _ O
business _ O
partners _ O
and _ O
Indian _ O
missions _ O
across _ O
the _ O
world _ O
, _ O
we _ O
managed _ O
to _ O
secure _ O
a _ O
massive _ O
life-saving _ O
inventory _ O
of _ O
these _ O
critical _ O
items _ O
, _ O
the _ O
biggest _ O
of _ O
which _ O
we _ O
brought _ O
in _ O
with _ O
the _ O
help _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
Air _ O
Force _ O
. _ O

Back _ O
home _ O
, _ O
our _ O
indefatigable _ O
logistics _ O
teams _ O
ensured _ O
that _ O
the _ O
oxygen _ O
tanks _ O
and _ O
cylinders _ O
were _ O
repeatedly _ O
refilled _ O
and _ O
despatched _ O
to _ O
all _ O
corners _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
also _ O
proud _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Foundation _ O
went _ O
well _ O
beyond _ O
procuring _ O
essential _ O
supplies _ O
. _ O

In _ O
just _ O
days _ O
, _ O
our _ O
engineering _ O
and _ O
medical _ O
teams _ O
expertly _ O
converted _ O
our _ O
Adani _ O
Vidya _ O
Mandir _ O
school _ O
in _ O
Ahmedabad _ O
and _ O

were _ O
swiftly _ O
turned _ O
into _ O

At _ O
no _ O
time _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
was _ O
the _ O
work _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Adani _ O
Foundation _ O
more _ O
necessary _ O
and _ O
relevant _ O
than _ O
it _ O
is _ O
now _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
deeply _ O
moved _ O
by _ O
the _ O
extent _ O
of _ O
the _ O
effort _ O
our _ O
Foundation _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
team _ O
members _ O
have _ O
put _ O
in _ O

often _ O
choosing _ O
to _ O
ignore _ O
the _ O
risk _ O
to _ O
their _ O

The _ O
Belief _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Long _ O
Term _ O
Over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
few _ O
months _ O
there _ O
have _ O
been _ O
several _ O
voices _ O
that _ O
wonder _ O
if _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
target _ O
to _ O
be _ O
a _ O
five-trillion-dollar _ O
economy _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
four _ O
years _ O
is _ O
achievable _ O
. _ O

I _ O
personally _ O
see _ O
it _ O
as _ O
an _ O
inconsequential _ O
question _ O
. _ O

History _ O
has _ O
amply _ O
demonstrated _ O
that _ O
out _ O
of _ O
every _ O
pandemic _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
emerge _ O
several _ O
learnings _ O
and _ O
I _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
India _ O
and _ O
the _ O
world _ O
become _ O
wiser _ O
as _ O
we _ O
go _ O
through _ O
this _ O
pandemic _ O
. _ O

India _ O
will _ O
be _ O
a _ O
five-trillion-dollar _ O
economy _ O
and _ O
will _ O
then _ O
go _ O
on _ O
to _ O
be _ O
a _ O
15 _ O
- _ O
trillion _ O
- _ O
dollar-plus _ O
economy _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
two _ O
decades _ O
, _ O
emerging _ O
as _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
largest _ O
global _ B-key
markets _ I-key
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
consumption _ O
size _ O
and _ O
market _ B-key

. _ O

There _ O
will _ O
be _ O
bumps _ O
along _ O
the _ O
road _ O
, _ O
as _ O
has _ O
been _ O
the _ O
case _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
, _ O
and _ O
is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
be _ O
the _ O
case _ O
in _ O
the _ O
future _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
there _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
any _ O
doubt _ O
that _ O
the _ O
largest _ O
middle-class _ O
that _ O

ever _ O
exist _ O
, _ O
augmented _ O
by _ O
an _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
the _ O
working _ O
age _ O
and _ O
consuming _ O

The _ O
most _ O
essential _ O
factor _ O
required _ O
will _ O
be _ O
a _ O
better _ O

and _ O
I _ O
have _ O
no _ O
reason _ O
to _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
two _ O

we _ O
will _ O
not _ O
have _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
suitably _ O
address _ O
this _ O
challenge _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
a _ O
virtuous _ O
cycle _ O
that _ O
is _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
the _ O
middle-class _ O
population _ O

India _ O
