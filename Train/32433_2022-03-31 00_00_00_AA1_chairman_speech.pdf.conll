Message _ O
The _ O
last _ O
two _ O
years _ O
have _ O
been _ O
a _ O
period _ O
of _ O
intense _ O
activity _ O
, _ O
learning _ O
and _ O
introspection _ O
for _ O
all _ O
of _ O
us _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
seen _ O
a _ O
deadly _ O
pandemic _ B-key
reshaping _ O
the _ O
contours _ O
of _ O
our _ O
lives _ O
and _ O
livelihoods _ O
, _ O
geopolitical _ B-key
tensions _ I-key
, _ O
supply _ B-key
chain _ I-key
disruptions _ O
and _ O
many _ O
other _ O
unpredictable _ O
headwinds _ O
. _ O

As _ O
economies _ O
and _ O
businesses _ O
gradually _ O
settle _ O
down _ O
to _ O
normalcy _ O
, _ O
I _ O
believe _ O
there _ O
are _ O
credible _ O
reasons _ O
for _ O
optimism _ O
for _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

Historically _ O
speaking _ O
, _ O
every _ O
crisis _ O
in _ O
human _ O
history _ O
has _ O
always _ O
revealed _ O
the _ O
true _ O
spirit _ O
of _ O
humanity _ O
. _ O

The _ O
last _ O
two _ O
years _ O
have _ O
further _ O
reinforced _ O
the _ O
truth _ O
of _ O
this _ O
saying _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
country _ O
has _ O
demonstrated _ O
remarkable _ O
resilience _ O
in _ O
these _ O
tumultuous _ O
times _ O
, _ O
and _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
economy _ B-key
has _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
grow _ O
at _ O
a _ O
decent _ O
pace _ O
, _ O
notwithstanding _ O
challenges _ O
. _ O

If _ O
we _ O
take _ O
a _ O
longer-term _ O
horizon _ O
, _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
our _ O
domestic _ O
paint _ B-key
industry _ I-key
has _ O
always _ O
exceeded _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
GDP _ B-key
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
always _ O
believed _ O
in _ O
the _ O
India _ O
Growth _ O
Story _ O
, _ O
and _ O
the _ O
phenomenal _ O
success _ O
of _ O
Berger _ O
is _ O
closely _ O
intertwined _ O
with _ O
the _ O
social _ O
and _ O
economic _ O
transformation _ O
of _ O
India _ O
after _ O
Independence _ O
. _ O

In _ O
all _ O
these _ O
decades _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
navigated _ O
through _ O
myriad _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
but _ O
each _ O
adversity _ O
has _ O
given _ O
us _ O
the _ O
opportunity _ O
to _ O
redefine _ O
our _ O
strength _ O
and _ O
embrace _ O
emerging _ O
opportunities _ O
. _ O

Redefining _ O
strength _ O
at _ O
Berger _ O
means _ O
continuous _ O
learning _ O
from _ O
the _ O
past _ O
and _ O
present _ O
and _ O
innovating _ O
our _ O
way _ O
forward _ O
to _ O
create _ O
a _ O
more _ O
vibrant _ O
future _ O
for _ O
all _ O
stakeholders _ O
. _ O

We _ O
try _ O
to _ O
think _ O
like _ O
the _ O
potential _ O
customer _ O
, _ O
empathise _ O
with _ O
his _ O
/ _ O
her _ O
concerns _ O
, _ O
aspirations _ O
, _ O
lifestyles _ O
, _ O
and _ O
then _ O
go _ O
back _ O
to _ O
the _ O
drawing _ O
board _ O
and _ O
re-imagine _ O
. _ O

The _ O
result _ O
is _ O
an _ O
impressive _ O
array _ O
of _ O
innovation _ O
that _ O
our _ O
patrons _ O
adore _ O
. _ O

Now _ O

During _ O

Dear _ O
