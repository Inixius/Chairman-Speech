Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
It _ O
was _ O
around _ O
FY _ O
2008 _ O
when _ O
global _ O
financial _ B-key
crisis _ I-key
plunged _ O
businesses _ O
into _ O
a _ O
VUCA _ O
( _ O
Volatile _ O
, _ O
Uncertain _ O
, _ O
Complex _ O
& _ O
Ambiguity _ O
) _ O
environment _ O
. _ O

The _ O
world _ O
seemingly _ O
hasn _ O
’ _ O
t _ O
changed _ O
much _ O
in _ O
these _ O
10 _ O
years _ O
as _ O
we _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
grapple _ O
with _ O
VUCA _ O
and _ O
a _ O
stable _ O
global _ O
environment _ O
is _ O
still _ O
elusive _ O
. _ O

Closer _ O
home _ O
, _ O
India _ O
experienced _ O
its _ O
own _ O
disruption _ O
with _ O
an _ O
unprecedented _ O
and _ O
audacious _ O
act _ O
of _ O
demonetisation _ B-key
. _ O

In _ O
a _ O
purported _ O
bid _ O
to _ O
weed _ O
out _ O
black _ O
money _ O
, _ O
nearly _ O
85% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
currency _ B-key
in _ O
circulation _ O
was _ O
sucked _ O
out _ O
of _ O
the _ O
system _ O
. _ O

The _ O
sudden _ O
act _ O
, _ O
led _ O
to _ O
utter _ O
uncertainty _ O
, _ O
chaos _ O
and _ O
insecurity _ O
that _ O
gripped _ O
businesses _ O
& _ O
individuals _ O
alike _ O
. _ O

Havells _ O
swiftly _ O
reviewed _ O
the _ O
emerging _ O
scenario _ O
, _ O
in _ O
respect _ O
to _ O
our _ O
key _ O
stakeholders _ O
including _ O
dealer _ O
channel _ O
. _ O

We _ O
realised _ O
that _ O
dealers _ O
were _ O
at _ O
a _ O
loss _ B-key
on _ O
how _ O
to _ O
react _ O
to _ O
demonetisation _ B-key
requiring _ O
communication _ O
and _ O
guidance _ O
. _ O

Your _ O
Company _ O
immediately _ O
arranged _ O
a _ O
simultaneous _ O
audio _ O
broadcast _ O
with _ O
5000 _ O
dealers _ O
wherein _ O
I _ O
along _ O
with _ O
the _ O
team _ O
addressed _ O
their _ O
anxieties _ O
and _ O
concerns _ O
clarifying _ O
how _ O
the _ O
current _ O
demonetisation _ B-key
would _ O
be _ O
beneficial _ O
in _ O
the _ O
long _ O
term _ O
and _ O
extended _ O
certain _ O
relaxation _ O
for _ O
their _ O
immediate _ O
worries _ O
on _ O
sale _ O
and _ O
cash _ O
collection _ O

that _ O
we _ O
manage _ O
this _ O
entire _ O

period _ O
in _ O
an _ O

manner _ O
, _ O
normalising _ O
operations _ O
in _ O
a _ O

Our _ O
outreach _ O
generated _ O
significant _ O
goodwill _ O
and _ O
appreciation _ O
from _ O
partners _ O
and _ O
further _ O
cemented _ O
our _ O
reputation _ O
as _ O
a _ O
dealer-friendly _ O
company _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
was _ O
capped _ O
by _ O
the _ O
significant _ O
acquisition _ O
of _ O
Lloyd _ O
consumer _ B-key
business _ I-key
, _ O
marking _ O
Havells _ O
foray _ O
into _ O
large _ O
appliances _ O
like _ O
air _ O

, _ O
LED _ O

& _ O
Washing _ O

. _ O

The _ O
acquisition _ O
is _ O
in _ O
line _ O
with _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
strategy _ O
of _ O
delving _ O
‘ _ O
Deeper _ O
into _ O
Homes _ O

with _ O
a _ O
fast _ O
growing _ O
Lloyd _ O
brand _ O
and _ O
a _ O
well _ O
oriented _ O
distribution _ O
and _ O
service _ O
network _ O
. _ O

Consumer _ O
durables _ O
is _ O
a _ O
high _ O
growth _ O
segment _ O
led _ O
by _ O
a _ O
lower _ O
penetration _ O
, _ O
increasing _ O
urbanisation _ O
and _ O
expanding _ O
aspirational _ O
middle _ O
class _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
confident _ O
that _ O
the _ O
acquisition _ O
would _ O
contribute _ O
significant _ O
value _ O
to _ O
our _ O
shareholders _ O
. _ O

Beyond _ O
acquisition _ O
, _ O
we _ O
made _ O
meaningful _ O
progress _ O
in _ O
other _ O
business _ O
through _ O
launch _ O
of _ O
new _ B-key
products _ I-key
, _ O
extensions _ O
and _ O
categories _ O
. _ O

We _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
innovate _ B-key
and _ O
created _ O
opportunities _ O
, _ O
bolstered _ O
revenue _ B-key
in _ O
each _ O
product _ B-key
category _ I-key
. _ O

While _ O
the _ O
Company _ O

revenue _ B-key
grew _ O
by _ O
14% _ O
, _ O
the _ O
profitability _ B-key
grew _ O
by _ O

. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
back _ O
of _ O
consistent _ O
feedback _ O
and _ O
expectations _ O
of _ O
consumers _ O
, _ O
we _ O
introduced _ O
a _ O
wide _ O
range _ O
of _ O
personal _ O
grooming _ O
products _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
for _ O
the _ O
youth _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
also _ O
introduced _ O
high _ O
quality _ O
air _ O
coolers _ O
that _ O
will _ O
be _ O
indigenously _ O
manufactured _ O
at _ O
our _ O
Neemrana _ O

In _ O
