In _ O
the _ O
recent _ O
elections _ O
, _ O
the _ O
mandate _ O
received _ O
by _ O
the _ O
government _ O
is _ O
an _ O
indication _ O
that _ O
the _ O
citizens _ O
of _ O
our _ O
country _ O
have _ O
voted _ O
for _ O
stability _ O
in _ O
support _ O
of _ O
a _ O
vision _ O
that _ O
addresses _ O
large _ O
segments _ O
of _ O
the _ O
society _ O
in _ O
a _ O
fashion _ O
and _ O

that _ O
will _ O
radically _ O
change _ O
India _ O

In _ O
an _ O
analysis _ O
published _ O
earlier _ O
this _ O
year _ O
, _ O
the _ O
World _ O
Economic _ O
Forum _ O
predicted _ O
that _ O
India _ O
would _ O
have _ O
lifted _ O
2.5 _ O
crore _ O
more _ O
households _ O
out _ O
of _ O
poverty _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O

, _ O
thereby _ O
reducing _ O
the _ O
share _ O
to _ O
households _ O
below _ O
the _ O
poverty _ O
line _ O
to _ O
5% _ O
. _ O

For _ O
a _ O
size _ O
of _ O
our _ O
country _ O
, _ O
these _ O
are _ O
staggering _ O
statistics _ O
and _ O
a _ O
harbinger _ O
of _ O
hope _ O
and _ O
optimism _ O
for _ O
the _ O

there _ O

be _ O
challenges _ O
and _ O
not _ O
all _ O

may _ O
get _ O
executed _ O
to _ O
perfection _ O
, _ O
but _ O
there _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
any _ O
denying _ O
of _ O
the _ O
fact _ O
that _ O
the _ O
ambitions _ O
of _ O
our _ O

are _ O
taking _ O
