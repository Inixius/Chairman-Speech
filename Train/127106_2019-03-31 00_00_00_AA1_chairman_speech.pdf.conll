up _ O
by _ O
the _ O

We _ O

usher _ O

Economic _ O
Scenario _ O
india _ O

FY2019 _ O
is _ O
estimated _ O
to _ O
have _ O
grown _ O
by _ O
around _ O
7 _ O
per _ O

While _ O
this _ O
is _ O
a _ O
laudable _ O
achievement _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
global _ O
context _ O
, _ O
it _ O
falls _ O
marginally _ O
short _ O
of _ O
expectations _ B-key
due _ O
to _ O
an _ O
interplay _ O
of _ O
macro-economic _ B-key
and _ O
political _ B-key
factors _ O
. _ O

These _ O
include _ O
the _ O
uncertainties _ O
which _ O
invariably _ O
accompany _ O
our _ O
General _ O
Elections _ O
, _ O
volatility _ O
in _ O

prices _ I-key
and _ O
unpredictable _ O

The _ O

also _ O
had _ O
to _ O
grapple _ O
with _ O
a _ O

precipitated _ O

. _ O

on _ O
a _ O
positive _ O
note _ O
, _ O
the _ O
country _ O
has _ O
largely _ O
got _ O
back _ O
on _ O
track _ O
after _ O
the _ O
initial _ O
disruptive _ O
effects _ O
of _ O
twin _ O
reform _ O
measures _ O
, _ O
viz _ O
. _ O
, _ O
Demonetisation _ O
and _ O
GST _ O
. _ O

The _ O
longer-term _ O
benefits _ O
of _ O
both _ O
these _ O
measures _ O
are _ O
gradually _ O
being _ O
realised _ O
through _ O
an _ O
uptick _ O

should _ O
help _ O
the _ O

it _ O
is _ O
also _ O
