The _ O
adverse _ O
impact _ O
of _ O
a _ O
mix _ O
of _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ O
, _ O
armed _ O
conflict _ O
and _ O
climate _ O
change _ O
has _ O
exposed _ O
the _ O
fragility _ O
of _ O
the _ O
global _ O
system _ O
that _ O
we _ O
had _ O
largely _ O
considered _ O
as _ O
having _ O
competently _ O
learned _ O
how _ O
to _ O
manage _ O
itself _ O
. _ O

It _ O
has _ O
now _ O
dawned _ O
on _ O
governments _ O
across _ O
the _ O
world _ O
that _ O
the _ O
implications _ O
of _ O
this _ O
multidimensional _ O
crisis _ O
are _ O
hard _ O
to _ O
predict _ O
, _ O
may _ O
complicate _ O
further _ O
and _ O
that _ O
signs _ O
of _ O
its _ O
damaging _ O
effects _ O
— _ O
uncontrolled _ O
inflation _ O
, _ O
disrupted _ O
food _ O
supplies _ O
, _ O
increased _ O
human _ O
displacement _ O
, _ O
exposed _ O
healthcare _ O
machinery _ O
, _ O
stalled _ O
education _ O
levels _ O
and _ O
faltering _ O

creation _ O

— _ O
are _ O
evident _ O
and _ O
testing _ O
the _ O

of _ O

Resilience _ O
is _ O
defined _ O
as _ O
the _ O
characteristic _ O
that _ O
makes _ O
it _ O
possible _ O
to _ O
rebound _ O
into _ O
shape _ O
; _ O
it _ O
is _ O
the _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
withstand _ O
crises _ O
; _ O
it _ O
is _ O
the _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
face _ O
uncertainties _ O
with _ O
curiosity _ O
and _ O
optimism _ O
. _ O

This _ O
capacity _ O
to _ O
rebound _ O
is _ O
becoming _ O
harder _ O
to _ O
model _ O
or _ O
predict _ O
as _ O
the _ O
crises _ O
drivers _ O
are _ O
becoming _ O
harder _ O
to _ O
anticipate _ O
and _ O
increasingly _ O
intermingled _ O
. _ O

While _ O
there _ O
is _ O
always _ O
room _ O
for _ O
debate _ O
, _ O
there _ O
can _ O
be _ O
no _ O
denying _ O
that _ O
, _ O
looking _ O
back _ O
, _ O
India _ O
has _ O
emerged _ O
far _ O
better _ O
in _ O
its _ O
handling _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Covid _ O
- _ O
19 _ O
crisis _ O
from _ O
the _ O
humanitarian _ O
and _ O
economic _ O
perspectives _ O
than _ O
most _ O
developed _ O
economies _ O
. _ O

India _ O
has _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
take _ O
a _ O
mature _ O
approach _ O
to _ O
the _ O
ongoing _ O
conflict _ O
and _ O
has _ O
been _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
most _ O
aggressive _ O
nations _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
establishing _ O
a _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
target _ O
for _ O
itself _ O
; _ O
while _ O
doing _ O
all _ O
of _ O
this _ O
, _ O
India _ O
has _ O
also _ O
emerged _ O
as _ O
the _ O
fastest _ O
growing _ O
major _ O
economy _ O
. _ O

The _ O
overarching _ O
takeaway _ O
is _ O
that _ O
despite _ O
global _ O
instability _ O
, _ O
India _ O
has _ O
fared _ O
better _ O
than _ O
almost _ O
any _ O
other _ O
major _ O
nation _ O
. _ O

While _ O
there _ O
were _ O
situations _ O
over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
24 _ O
months _ O
when _ O
it _ O
appeared _ O
that _ O
events _ O
were _ O
getting _ O
out _ O
of _ O
control _ O
, _ O
we _ O
must _ O
give _ O
credit _ O
where _ O
credit _ O
is _ O
due _ O
— _ O
India _ O
was _ O
able _ O
to _ O
bounce _ O
back _ O

to _ O
our _ O

In _ O
my _ O
view _ O
, _ O
utopian _ O
as _ O
some _ O
may _ O
call _ O
it _ O
, _ O
India _ O
’ _ O

resilience _ O

in _ O

never _ O

To _ O
use _ O
a _ O

we _ O
are _ O
now _ O
playing _ O
on _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
strongest _ O
home _ O
grounds _ O
and _ O
on _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
firmest _ O
pitches _ O
that _ O
has _ O
ever _ O

In _ O

it _ O

this _ O

The _ O
primary _ O
reason _ O
for _ O
the _ O
success _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Adani _ O

comes _ O
from _ O
our _ O
alignment _ O
with _ O

and _ O
never _ O
have _ O
we _ O
feared _ O
to _ O
enter _ O
adjacent _ O
sectors _ O
– _ O
our _ O
resilience _ O
comes _ O
from _ O
this _ O
unshakeable _ O
belief _ O
and _ O
confidence _ O
in _ O
the _ O
aspirations _ O
of _ O
our _ O
fellow _ O
Indians _ O
and _ O
the _ O

of _ O

During _ O
the _ O
journey _ O
of _ O
more _ O
than _ O
25 _ O
years _ O
, _ O
there _ O
were _ O
uncharted _ O
waters _ O
we _ O
entered _ O

multidimensional _ O
crises _ O
that _ O
we _ O
faced _ O
. _ O

While _ O
we _ O
may _ O
have _ O

a _ O

times _ O
, _ O
we _ O
were _ O
always _ O
able _ O
to _ O
get _ O
back _ O
on _ O
our _ O
feet _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
rise _ O
after _ O
every _ O
stumble _ O
meant _ O
we _ O
grew _ O
bigger _ O
and _ O
stronger _ O
by _ O
drawing _ O
on _ O
our _ O
experience _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
these _ O
experiences _ O
that _ O
have _ O
enriched _ O
us _ O
with _ O
resilience _ O
and _ O
laid _ O
the _ O
foundation _ O
of _ O
our _ O
optimism _ O

a _ O

level _ O

our _ O

the _ O

continued _ O

A _ O

It _ O
is _ O

that _ O

to _ O
take _ O
a _ O
moment _ O
to _ O
reflect _ O
on _ O
2022 _ O

a _ O
year _ O

role _ O

father _ O
Shri _ O
Shantilal _ O
Adani _ O
, _ O
and _ O
my _ O
60th _ O
birthday _ O
. _ O

To _ O
mark _ O
this _ O
milestone _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Adani _ O
family _ O
came _ O
together _ O
and _ O
decided _ O
to _ O

development _ I-key
, _ O
especially _ O
for _ O

India _ O
. _ O

These _ O
three _ O
areas _ O
should _ O
be _ O
seen _ O
holistically _ O
, _ O
rather _ O
than _ O
separately _ O
, _ O
because _ O
they _ O
collectively _ O
form _ O
the _ O
drivers _ O
for _ O
an _ O
equitable _ O
and _ O
future-ready _ O
India _ O
. _ O

have _ O
an _ O
opportunity _ O
in _ O

to _ O
decisively _ O
lift _ O
tens _ O
of _ O
millions _ O
of _ O
people _ O

owe _ O
it _ O

do _ O
everything _ O

Getting _ O
back _ O
to _ O
the _ O
theme _ O
of _ O
optimism _ O
as _ O
a _ O
driving _ O
force _ O
for _ O
a _ O
society _ O
, _ O
Martin _ O
Seligman _ O
, _ O
often _ O
referred _ O
to _ O
as _ O
the _ O
‘ _ O
father _ O
of _ O
positive _ O
psychology _ O
’ _ O
, _ O
wrote _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Harvard _ O
Business _ O
Review _ O
that _ O
he _ O
came _ O
to _ O
his _ O
insights _ O
into _ O
the _ O
power _ O
of _ O
optimism _ O
‘ _ O
the _ O
long _ O
, _ O
hard _ O
way _ O
, _ O
through _ O
many _ O
years _ O
of _ O
research _ O
on _ O
failure _ O
and _ O
helplessness _ O
. _ O
’ _ O

Essentially _ O
, _ O
he _ O
discovered _ O
over _ O
several _ O
years _ O
of _ O
studies _ O
, _ O
that _ O
resilient _ O
people _ O
develop _ O
the _ O
courage _ O
of _ O
interpreting _ O
setbacks _ O
as _ O
temporary _ O
, _ O
local _ O
and _ O
changeable _ O

A _ O
quote _ O
attributed _ O
to _ O
Winston _ O
Churchill _ O
echoes _ O

’ _ O
s _ O
findings _ O
on _ O
resilience _ O
. _ O

“ _ O
Success _ O
is _ O
not _ O
final _ O
, _ O
” _ O
Churchill _ O
is _ O
supposed _ O
to _ O
have _ O
said _ O
, _ O
“ _ O
failure _ O
is _ O
not _ O
fatal _ O
: _ O
it _ O
is _ O
the _ O
courage _ O
to _ O
continue _ O
that _ O
counts _ O
. _ O
” _ O

The _ O
reason _ O
I _ O
have _ O
always _ O
been _ O
inspired _ O
by _ O
writing _ O
and _ O
thinking _ O
around _ O
resilience _ O
is _ O
because _ O
as _ O
an _ O
entrepreneur _ O
, _ O
my _ O
philosophy _ O
has _ O
always _ O
been _ O
to _ O
keep _ O
trying _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
an _ O
incurable _ O
optimist _ O
. _ O

My _ O
optimism _ O
is _ O
founded _ O
on _ O
my _ O
belief _ O
in _ O
our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
create _ O
a _ O
better _ O
future _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
why _ O
I _ O
always _ O
argue _ O
that _ O
India _ O
has _ O
become _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
greatest _ O
countries _ O
in _ O
which _ O
to _ O
be _ O
an _ O
entrepreneur _ O
. _ O

The _ O
prospects _ O
and _ O
potential _ O
for _ O
the _ O
future _ O
are _ O
dazzlingly _ O
bright _ O
. _ O

In _ O
India _ O
, _ O
I _ O
see _ O
a _ O
real _ O
relish _ O
to _ O
finally _ O
reclaim _ O
our _ O
former _ O
economic _ O
stature _ O
and _ O
our _ O
position _ O
as _ O
a _ O
pivotal _ O
force _ O
in _ O
global _ O
affairs _ O
. _ O

There _ O
will _ O
be _ O
bumps _ O
along _ O
the _ O
road _ O
, _ O
as _ O
has _ O
been _ O
the _ O
case _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
, _ O
and _ O
is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
be _ O
the _ O
case _ O
in _ O
the _ O
future _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
there _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
any _ O
doubt _ O
that _ O
the _ O
largest _ O
middle-class _ O
that _ O
will _ O
ever _ O
exist _ O
, _ O
augmented _ O
by _ O
an _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
the _ O
working _ O
age _ O
and _ O

will _ O

in _ O
