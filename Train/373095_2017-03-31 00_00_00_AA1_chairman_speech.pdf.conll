Message _ O
from _ O
Chairman _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
The _ O
year _ O
gone _ O
by _ O
was _ O
a _ O
transformational _ O
year _ O
for _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
Telecom _ O
industry _ O
with _ O
continued _ O
growth _ B-key
in _ O
subscribers _ O
, _ O
higher _ O
adoption _ O
of _ O
data _ O
services _ O
aided _ O
by _ O
spurt _ O
in _ O
smartphone _ O
penetration _ O
and _ O
deeper _ O
coverage _ O
of _ O
data _ O
networks _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
also _ O
successfully _ O
auctioned _ O
spectrum _ O
across _ O
multiple _ O
bands _ O
like _ O
1800 _ O
, _ O
2100 _ O
, _ O
2300 _ O
& _ O
2500 _ O
MHz _ O
and _ O
we _ O
also _ O
saw _ O
the _ O
launch _ O
of _ O
services _ O
by _ O
Reliance _ O
Jio _ O
that _ O
triggered _ O
the _ O
much-awaited _ O
industry _ O
consolidation _ O
. _ O

While _ O
several _ O
operators _ O
like _ O
Videocon _ O
and _ O
Telenor _ O
exited _ O
or _ O
merged _ O
into _ O
other _ O
operators _ O
; _ O
RCom _ O
, _ O
Aircel _ O
and _ O
MTS _ O
announced _ O
merger _ O
. _ O

Another _ O
major _ O
announcement _ O
was _ O
the _ O
proposed _ O
merger _ O
between _ O
Vodafone _ O
and _ O
Idea _ O
, _ O
the _ O
second _ O
and _ O
third _ O
largest _ O
operators _ O
. _ O

As _ O
far _ O
as _ O
tower _ O
industry _ O
is _ O
concerned _ O
, _ O
such _ O
consolidation _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
Voda _ O
- _ O
Idea _ O
merger _ O
, _ O
which _ O
may _ O
still _ O
be _ O
some _ O
time _ O
away _ O
if _ O
it _ O
fructifies _ O
will _ O
inevitably _ O
lead _ O
to _ O
short _ O
term _ O
& _ O
one-time _ O
rationalisation _ O
in _ O
tenancies _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
we _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
the _ O
consolidation _ O
leading _ O
to _ O
few _ O
but _ O
strong _ O
and _ O
willing _ O
participants _ O
is _ O
good _ O
for _ O
the _ O
tower _ O
industry _ O
in _ O
medium _ O
to _ O
long _ O
term _ O
