Chairman _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
message _ O
evident _ O
that _ O
I _ O
wanted _ O
to _ O
be _ O
a _ O
part _ O
of _ O
this _ O
company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
future _ O
. _ O

Everything _ O
that _ O
I _ O
have _ O
witnessed _ O
in _ O
the _ O
last _ O
several _ O
months _ O
makes _ O
me _ O
confident _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
is _ O
on _ O
the _ O
right _ O
track _ O
to _ O
deliver _ O
on _ O
that _ O
promise _ O
. _ O

Three _ O
things _ O
stand _ O
out _ O
: _ O
( _ O
i _ O
) _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
commitment _ O
to _ O
the _ O
highest _ O
standards _ O
of _ O
corporate _ O
governance _ O
, _ O
and _ O
intense _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
compliance _ O
and _ O
ethical _ O
conduct _ O
in _ O
everything _ O
we _ O
do _ O
, _ O
( _ O
ii _ O
) _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
move _ O
to _ O
strengthen _ O
commercial _ O
and _ O
operational _ O
controls _ O
, _ O
and _ O
institute _ O
robust _ O
systems _ O
and _ O
processes _ O
, _ O
and _ O
( _ O
iii _ O
) _ O
making _ O
the _ O
right _ O
investments _ O
– _ O
be _ O
it _ O
in _ O
talent _ O
, _ O
or _ O
brands _ O
, _ O
or _ O
our _ O
manufacturing _ O
facilities _ O
. _ O

In _ O
all _ O
of _ O
the _ O
above _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
has _ O
been _ O
fully _ O
supported _ O
by _ O
its _ O
principal _ O
shareholder _ O
Diageo _ O
. _ O

Despite _ O
many _ O
positive _ O
factors _ O
on _ O
the _ O
country _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
economic _ O
front _ O
, _ O
a _ O
matter _ O
of _ O
concern _ O
is _ O
an _ O
increasing _ O
recourse _ O
to _ O
Prohibition _ O
by _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
States _ O
in _ O
India _ O
. _ O

And _ O
yet _ O
, _ O
there _ O
is _ O
enough _ O
evidence _ O
to _ O
show _ O
that _ O
Prohibition _ O
doesn _ O
’ _ O
t _ O
curb _ O
alcoholism _ O
or _ O
social _ O
ills _ O
. _ O

I _ O
believe _ O
, _ O
rather _ O
than _ O
proceeding _ O
on _ O
the _ O
assumption _ O
that _ O
Prohibition _ O
is _ O
the _ O
solution _ O
to _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
social _ O
issues _ O
, _ O
formulation _ O
of _ O
a _ O
Public _ B-key
Policy _ I-key
on _ O
this _ O
issue _ O
deserves _ O
a _ O
wider _ O
debate _ O
that _ O
includes _ O
the _ O
adverse _ O
consequences _ O
of _ O
Prohibition _ O
, _ O
particularly _ O
the _ O
impetus _ O
Prohibition _ O
provides _ O
to _ O
the _ O
production _ O
and _ O
sale _ O
of _ O
illicit _ O
liquor _ O
with _ O
resultant _ O
ill-effects _ O
on _ O
public _ O
health _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
all _ O
too _ O
familiar _ O
with _ O
regular _ O
tragedies _ O
involving _ O
loss _ O
of _ O
human _ O
lives _ O
linked _ O
to _ O
the _ O
production _ O
and _ O
sale _ O
of _ O
illicit _ O
liquor _ O
. _ O

In _ O
addition _ O
to _ O
the _ O
loss _ O
of _ O
livelihoods _ O
, _ O
the _ O
loss _ O
of _ O
alcohol _ O
as _ O
a _ O
major _ O
source _ O
of _ O
a _ O
State _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
tax _ O
revenues _ O
negatively _ O
impacts _ O
its _ O
finances _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
the _ O
sustainability _ O
of _ O
welfare _ O
programmes _ O
for _ O
the _ O
underprivileged _ O
of _ O
the _ O
State _ O
. _ O

Prohibition _ O
also _ O
restricts _ O
the _ O
harnessing _ O
of _ O
the _ O
full _ O
potential _ O
of _ O
tourism _ O
in _ O
India _ O
and _ O
the _ O
concerned _ O
States _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
imperative _ O
that _ O
makers _ O
of _ O
Public _ O
Policy _ O
draw _ O
lessons _ O
from _ O
the _ O
consequences _ O
of _ O
short-lived _ O
attempts _ O
to _ O
introduce _ O
Prohibition _ O

Rather _ O
than _ O
making _ O
ad _ O
hoc _ O
or _ O
opportunistic _ O
decisions _ O
for _ O
short-term _ O
gains _ O
, _ O
I _ O
fervently _ O
hope _ O
they _ O
take _ O
a _ O
holistic _ O
and _ O
pragmatic _ O
approach _ O
to _ O
formulate _ O
a _ O
well-balanced _ O
and _ O
sustainable _ O
policy _ O
. _ O

India _ O
presents _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
most _ O
exciting _ O
opportunities _ O
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

The _ O
country _ O
is _ O
forging _ O
ahead _ O
as _ O
the _ O
fastest _ O
growing _ O
economy _ O
. _ O

What _ O
makes _ O
India _ O
particularly _ O
attractive _ O
is _ O
not _ O
just _ O
the _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
, _ O
but _ O
what _ O
constitutes _ O
and _ O
drives _ O
it _ O
. _ O

An _ O
upwardly _ O
mobile _ O
aspirational _ O
middle _ O

a _ O

that _ O
the _ O
