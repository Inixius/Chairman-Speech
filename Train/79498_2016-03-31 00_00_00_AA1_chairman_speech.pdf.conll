Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O

Events _ O
that _ O

during _ O
the _ O
previous _ O

both _ O

the _ O

The _ O
year _ O
has _ O
been _ O
a _ O
unique _ O
departure _ O
from _ O

price _ B-key
compression _ O
as _ O
the _ O

decline _ O
has _ O
coincided _ O

a _ O

emergence _ O

with _ O
a _ O

of _ O
improvements _ O
along _ O
the _ O

. _ O

Sustained _ O
investments _ B-key
have _ O
led _ O
to _ O
the _ O
highest _ O

of _ O

, _ O

At _ O

Interestingly _ O
, _ O
for _ O
India _ O

there _ O
has _ O
been _ O
a _ O
serious _ O

Government _ O

India _ O
( _ O

even _ O
helped _ O
revival _ O

On _ O
the _ O
retail _ O
side _ O
, _ O
gas _ O
gained _ O

Gaining _ O

from _ O
such _ O

, _ O
the _ O

shall _ O
