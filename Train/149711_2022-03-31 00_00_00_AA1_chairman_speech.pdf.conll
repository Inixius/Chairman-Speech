Chairman _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
Message _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ B-key
, _ O
I _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
start _ O
this _ O
letter _ O
with _ O
a _ O
note _ O
of _ O
appreciation _ O
. _ O

Thank _ O
you _ O
for _ O
your _ O
constant _ O
support _ O
and _ O
trust _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
during _ O
these _ O
dynamic _ O
times _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
since _ O
our _ O
last _ O
annual _ B-key
report _ I-key
has _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
witness _ O
the _ O
devastating _ O
effects _ O
of _ O
the _ O
second _ O
and _ O
third _ O
waves _ O
of _ O
the _ O
COVID _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
pandemic _ B-key
, _ O
and _ O
my _ O
thoughts _ O
remain _ O
with _ O
those _ O
who _ O
faced _ O
heartbreaking _ O
loss _ B-key
. _ O

Our _ O
priorities _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
hold _ O
true _ O
as _ O
we _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
the _ O
safety _ O
of _ O
our _ O
people _ O
and _ O
communities _ O
above _ O
all _ O
else _ O
. _ O

As _ O
the _ O
upward _ O
trajectory _ O
at _ O
the _ O
beginning _ O
of _ O
2021 _ O
came _ O
to _ O
a _ O
sudden _ O
halt _ O
, _ O
the _ O
economic _ B-key
recovery _ I-key
lost _ O
momentum _ O
. _ O

In _ O
FY _ O
2021 _ O
- _ O
22 _ O
, _ O
the _ O
world _ O
faced _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
including _ O
the _ O
war _ B-key
in _ O
Ukraine _ O
, _ O
the _ O
impact _ O
of _ O
which _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
judged _ O
yet _ O
. _ O

Apart _ O
from _ O
this _ O
, _ O
the _ O
coronavirus _ B-key
pandemic _ B-key
is _ O
still _ O
looming _ O
, _ O
causing _ O
intermediate _ O
lockdown _ B-key
in _ O
many _ O
nations _ O
. _ O

Worldwide _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
also _ O
confronted _ O
with _ O
severe _ O
supply _ O
shortages _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
of _ O
chips _ O
and _ O
other _ O
primary _ O
products _ O
, _ O
with _ O
a _ O
notable _ O
rise _ O
in _ O
the _ O
global _ O
consumer _ B-key
price _ I-key
index _ I-key
. _ O

The _ O
World _ O
Bank _ O
has _ O
forecasted _ O
a _ O
slump _ O
in _ O
global _ O
economic _ B-key
growth _ I-key
to _ O
2.9 _ O
percent _ O
in _ O
2022 _ O
, _ O
down _ O
from _ O
the _ O
4.1 _ O
percent _ O
forecasted _ O
in _ O
January _ O
, _ O
warning _ O
that _ O
above _ O
- _ O
average _ O
inflation _ B-key
and _ O
below-average _ O
growth _ O
would _ O
likely _ O
have _ O
potentially _ O
destabilizing _ O
consequences _ O
for _ O
low _ O
- _ O
and _ O
middle-income _ O
economies _ B-key
. _ O

Along _ O
similar _ O
lines _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Reserve _ O
Bank _ O
of _ O
India _ O
( _ O
RBI _ O
) _ O
has _ O
lowered _ O
its _ O
growth _ O
forecast _ O
for _ O
India _ O
to _ O
7.2 _ O
percent _ O
for _ O
FY _ O
2022 _ O
- _ O
23 _ O
. _ O

Like _ O
most _ O
central _ O
banks _ O
, _ O
RBI _ O
is _ O
trying _ O
to _ O
rein _ O
in _ O
inflation _ B-key
through _ O
continuous _ O
interest _ B-key
rate _ I-key
hikes _ O
, _ O
and _ O
intermittently _ O
growth _ O
is _ O
about _ O
to _ O
suffer _ O
. _ O

At _ O
the _ O
same _ O
time _ O
, _ O
our _ O
markets _ O
are _ O
in _ O
flux _ O
. _ O

The _ O
main _ O
reasons _ O
for _ O
this _ O
are _ O
well _ O
known _ O
: _ O
climate _ B-key
action _ I-key
, _ O
electrification _ B-key
, _ O
automation _ B-key
, _ O
and _ O

While _ O
EV _ O
will _ O
make _ O
inroads _ O
into _ O

, _ O
we _ O
still _ O
see _ O
the _ O
dominance _ O
of _ O
Internal _ B-key
Combustion _ I-key
