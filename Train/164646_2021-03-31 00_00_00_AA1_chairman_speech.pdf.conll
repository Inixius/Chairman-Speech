India _ O

the _ O
grip _ O
of _ O
second _ O

even _ O
third _ O
waves _ O
of _ O
the _ O

, _ O
much _ O
fiercer _ O
than _ O
anything _ O
we _ O
saw _ O
last _ O
year _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
a _ O
health _ B-key
crisis _ I-key
of _ O
the _ O
kind _ O
we _ O
have _ O
not _ O
seen _ O
in _ O
generations _ O

My _ O

I _ O

Technological _ B-key
change _ O
is _ O
far _ O
more _ O
perceptible _ B-key
when _ O
it _ O
comes _ O
to _ O
consumer _ B-key
technology _ O
, _ O
and _ O
less _ O
so _ O
in _ O
the _ O
enterprise _ B-key
world _ O
. _ O

Enterprise _ B-key
adoption _ O
of _ O
new _ O
technologies _ B-key
tends _ O
to _ O
be _ O
very _ O
measured _ O
, _ O
and _ O
it _ O
is _ O
only _ O
much _ O
later _ O
, _ O
with _ O
the _ O
benefit _ O
of _ O
hindsight _ O
, _ O
that _ O
the _ O
scale _ O
of _ O
change _ O
and _ O
the _ O
key _ O
inflection _ B-key
points _ O
become _ O
more _ O
evident _ O
. _ O

To _ O
my _ O
mind _ O
, _ O
the _ O
year _ O
gone _ O
by _ O
saw _ O
an _ O
important _ O
inflection _ B-key
point _ O
that _ O
has _ O
huge _ O
ramifications _ B-key
on _ O
enterprise _ O
consumption _ O
of _ O
technology _ O
in _ O
the _ O
coming _ O
years _ O
, _ O
and _ O
on _ O
demand _ O
for _ O
your _ O
company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
services _ O
. _ O

The _ O
pressing _ O
need _ O
for _ O
operational _ B-key
resilience _ O
and _ O
for _ O
enhancing _ O
customer _ B-key
experiences _ I-key
in _ O
digital _ B-key
channels _ I-key
accelerated _ O
enterprise _ O
decision-making _ B-key
, _ O
committing _ O
to _ O
future _ O
technology _ B-key
investments _ I-key
around _ O
the _ O
all-encompassing _ O
hyperscaler _ B-key
cloud _ B-key

This _ O
represents _ O
an _ O
important _ O
inflection _ O
point _ O
in _ O
the _ O
enterprise _ O
embrace _ O
of _ O
the _ O
cloud _ O
, _ O
and _ O
will _ O
drive _ O
significant _ O
spending _ O
on _ O
migrating _ B-key
workloads _ B-key
to _ O
public _ O
clouds _ O
in _ O
the _ O
coming _ O
years _ O

Moving _ O
workloads _ B-key
to _ O
the _ O

is _ O
just _ O
the _ O
start _ O
of _ O
their _ O
digital _ B-key
transformation _ I-key
journeys _ O

The _ O
rich _ O
native _ O
capabilities _ O
of _ O
these _ O

particularly _ O
in _ O
the _ O
areas _ O
of _ O
analytics _ B-key
, _ O
machine _ B-key
learning _ I-key
and _ O
artificial _ B-key
intelligence _ I-key
open _ O
up _ O
a _ O
vast _ O
array _ O
of _ O
possibilities _ O
for _ O
enterprises _ B-key

the _ O
