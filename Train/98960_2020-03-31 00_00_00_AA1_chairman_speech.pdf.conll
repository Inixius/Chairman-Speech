We _ O

, _ O
our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O

Trade _ B-key

resulted _ O
in _ O

in _ O

severely _ O
impacted _ O

The _ O

wreaked _ O
havoc _ O
across _ O
the _ O

as _ O
lives _ O
were _ O

and _ O

became _ O
rampant _ O

Economic _ O
activity _ O

to _ O

In _ O
a _ O

we _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
grapple _ O
with _ O
the _ O

As _ O

, _ O
the _ O
global _ O

emerged _ O
as _ O

of _ O
the _ O
worst _ O
hit _ O
sectors _ O
. _ O

In _ O
difficult _ O
times _ O
such _ O
as _ O
this _ O
, _ O
what _ O
mattered _ O
was _ O
our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
rethink _ O
the _ O

together _ O
and _ O
take _ O

to _ O
achieve _ O
our _ O

In _ O

Further _ O
, _ O
we _ O

we _ O
plan _ O
to _ O

We _ O
also _ O
realize _ O
that _ O
our _ O
digital _ B-key
infrastructure _ I-key
is _ O
constantly _ O
at _ O
risk _ O
and _ O
have _ O
therefore _ O
, _ O
resorted _ O
to _ O

to _ O
protect _ O
our _ O

from _ O

Accordingly _ O

will _ O
be _ O
deployed _ O
in _ O
