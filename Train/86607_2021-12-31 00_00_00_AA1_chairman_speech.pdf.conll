for _ O
all _ O
DEAR _ O
STAKEHOLDERS _ B-key
, _ O
At _ O
the _ O
onset _ O
, _ O
I _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
express _ O
my _ O
heartfelt _ O
gratitude _ O
to _ O
our _ O
frontline _ O
workers _ O
, _ O
whose _ O
untiring _ O
efforts _ O
at _ O
ensuring _ O
the _ O
safety _ O
and _ O
well-being _ O
of _ O
our _ O
employees _ O
and _ O
communities _ O
have _ O
allowed _ O
us _ O
to _ O
hold _ O
our _ O
heads _ O
high _ O
, _ O
and _ O
continue _ O
our _ O
operations _ O
without _ O
disruptions _ O
. _ O

Despite _ O
the _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
create _ O
sustained _ O
value _ B-key
for _ O
our _ O
stakeholders _ B-key
, _ O
and _ O
, _ O
as _ O
an _ O
industry _ O
frontrunner _ O
, _ O
retain _ O
our _ O
leadership _ B-key
position _ O
through _ O
improved _ O
production _ B-key
, _ O
cost _ B-key
and _ O
distribution _ O
efficiency _ O
, _ O
and _ O
sustainability _ O
initiatives _ O
. _ O

For _ O
the _ O
cement _ O
industry _ O
in _ O
general _ O
, _ O
2021 _ O
started _ O
on _ O
a _ O
robust _ O
note _ O
, _ O
with _ O
strong _ O
signs _ O
of _ O
demand _ B-key
recovery _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
the _ O
second _ O
wave _ O
of _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ B-key
disrupted _ O
the _ O
market _ B-key
, _ O
led _ O
by _ O
localised _ O
lockdowns _ O
and _ O
a _ O
dampened _ O
consumer _ B-key
sentiment _ I-key
. _ O

Further _ O
, _ O
the _ O
unprecedented _ O
hike _ O
in _ O
fuel _ O
prices _ B-key
created _ O
cost _ B-key
pressures _ O
. _ O

Demand _ B-key
was _ O
particularly _ O
impacted _ O
during _ O
the _ O
fourth _ O
quarter _ O
of _ O
2021 _ O
by _ O
unexpected _ O
rains _ O
in _ O
different _ O
parts _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
, _ O
a _ O
ban _ O
on _ O
construction _ O
activities _ O
in _ O
the _ O
National _ O
Capital _ O
Region _ O
( _ O
NCR _ O
) _ O
, _ O
and _ O
shortage _ O
of _ O
labour _ O
and _ O
sand _ O
. _ O

Notwithstanding _ O
these _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
reported _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
best _ O
performances _ O
in _ O
the _ O
recent _ O
past _ O
, _ O
registering _ O
substantial _ O
growth _ O
across _ O
both _ O
financial _ B-key
and _ O
non-financial _ O
metrics _ O
. _ O

I _ O
join _ O
the _ O
Board _ O
in _ O
thanking _ O
the _ O
team _ O
for _ O
demonstrating _ O
resilience _ O
and _ O
agility _ O
and _ O
delivering _ O
on _ O
our _ O
set _ O
objectives _ O
. _ O

We _ O
registered _ O
a _ O
volume _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
17% _ O
year-on-year _ O
. _ O

We _ O
strengthened _ O
our _ O
revenues _ B-key
by _ O
23% _ O
while _ O
EBITDA _ B-key
and _ O
profit _ B-key
after _ I-key
tax _ I-key
reported _ O
a _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
21% _ O
and _ O
16% _ O
, _ O
respectively _ O
, _ O
over _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

OUR _ O
MOMENT _ O
OF _ O
PRIDE _ O
Equally _ O
noteworthy _ O
are _ O
the _ O
significant _ O
interventions _ O
made _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Ambuja _ O
Cement _ O
Foundation _ O
( _ O
ACF _ O
) _ O
, _ O
our _ O
CSR _ O
arm _ O
, _ O
in _ O
tackling _ O
the _ O
fallout _ O
of _ O
the _ O
second _ O
wave _ O
on _ O
the _ O
health _ B-key
infrastructure _ I-key
and _ O
community _ O
well-being _ O
. _ O

Having _ O
meticulously _ O
mapped _ O
locations _ O
that _ O
saw _ O
a _ O
surge _ O
in _ O
cases _ O
, _ O
and _ O
thereby _ O
areas _ O
which _ O
were _ O
in _ O
critical _ O
need _ O
of _ O
oxygen _ O
, _ O
ACF _ O
8 _ O
went _ O
about _ O
methodically _ O
to _ O
distribute _ O
oxygen _ O
concentrators _ O
and _ O
cylinders _ O
. _ O

Not _ O
stopping _ O
at _ O
that _ O
, _ O
we _ O
set _ O
up _ O
oxygen _ O
plants _ O
at _ O
Dadri _ O
and _ O
Ambujanagar _ O
. _ O

ACF _ O
  _ O
also _ O
trained _ O
community _ O
volunteers _ O
as _ O
CoviSainiks _ O
to _ O
provide _ O
help _ O
at _ O
hospitals _ O
and _ O
community _ O
clinics _ O
. _ O

We _ O
actively _ O
participated _ O
in _ O
furthering _ O
the _ O
government _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
immunisation _ O
mission _ O
, _ O
with _ O
ACF _ O
pitching _ O
in _ O
to _ O
help _ O
vaccinate _ O
more _ O
than _ O
2.7 _ O
million _ O
community _ O
members _ O
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
also _ O
a _ O
remarkable _ O
year _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
our _ O
commitment _ O
towards _ O
creating _ O
a _ O
sustainable _ O
future _ O
for _ O
all _ O
. _ O

Following _ O
the _ O
lead _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Holcim _ O
Group _ O
, _ O
we _ O
developed _ O
and _ O
had _ O
our _ O
2030 _ O
carbon _ O
emission _ O
reduction _ O
targets _ O
validated _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Science _ B-key
Based _ I-key
Targets _ I-key
initiative _ I-key
( _ O
SBTi _ B-key
) _ O
. _ O

At _ O
Ambuja _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
consistently _ O
aimed _ O
at _ O
including _ O
sustainability _ O
in _ O
all _ O
our _ O
operational _ O
and _ O
project _ O
planning _ O
. _ O

This _ O
year _ O
as _ O
well _ O
, _ O
we _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
reduce _ O
our _ O
carbon _ O
footprint _ O
by _ O
lowering _ O
the _ O
clinker _ O
factor _ O
, _ O
reducing _ O
thermal _ O
and _ O
electrical _ O
energy _ O
intensity _ O
, _ O
while _ O
implementing _ O
Waste _ O
Heat _ O
Recovery _ O
Systems _ O
at _ O
our _ O
plants _ O
and _ O
increasing _ O
our _ O
use _ O
of _ O
and _ O
capacity _ O
of _ O
generating _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
. _ O

At _ O
the _ O
same _ O
time _ O
, _ O
we _ O
remain _ O
committed _ O
to _ O
catering _ O
to _ O
the _ O
evolving _ O
requirements _ O
of _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
, _ O
enabling _ O
them _ O
to _ O
build _ O
more _ O
durable _ O
and _ O
sustainable _ O
structures _ O
with _ O
materials _ O
that _ O
are _ O
made _ O

OPPORTUNITIES _ O
AT _ O
HAND _ O
We _ O
look _ O
at _ O
the _ O
future _ O
with _ O
unflagging _ O
enthusiasm _ O

India _ O
continues _ O
to _ O
remain _ O
the _ O
second-largest _ O
cement _ O
producer _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

The _ O
industry _ O
offers _ O
significant _ O
headroom _ O
for _ O
growth _ O
aided _ O
by _ O
low _ O
per _ O

consumption _ I-key
and _ O
a _ O
massive _ O
government _ O
push _ O
for _ O

Furthermore _ O
, _ O
the _ O

in _ O
