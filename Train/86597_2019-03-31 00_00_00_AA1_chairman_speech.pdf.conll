Greetings _ O
! _ O

We _ O
live _ O
in _ O
interesting _ O
times _ O
. _ O

India _ O
continues _ O
to _ O
be _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
world _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
fastest _ O
growing _ O
economies _ B-key
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
become _ O
the _ O
world _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
fifth _ O
largest _ O
nation _ O
by _ O
the _ O
end _ O
of _ O
this _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
country _ O
is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
see _ O
an _ O
investment _ B-key
of _ O
a _ O
trillion _ O
dollars _ O
in _ O
infrastructure _ B-key
, _ O
split _ O
evenly _ O
between _ O
public _ O
and _ O
private _ O
sector _ O
resources _ O
and _ O
is _ O
on _ O
its _ O
way _ O
to _ O
become _ O
a _ O
five-trillion-dollar _ O
economy _ B-key
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
five _ O
years _ O
. _ O

India _ O
at _ O
an _ O
inflection _ O
point _ O
In _ O
the _ O
recent _ O
elections _ O
, _ O
the _ O
mandate _ O
received _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
is _ O
an _ O
indication _ O
that _ O
the _ O
citizens _ O
of _ O
our _ O
country _ O
have _ O
voted _ O
for _ O
stability _ O
in _ O
support _ O
of _ O
a _ O
vision _ O
that _ O
addresses _ O
large _ O
segments _ O
of _ O
the _ O
society _ O
in _ O
a _ O
fashion _ O
and _ O
scale _ O
that _ O
will _ O
radically _ O
change _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
development _ O
trajectory _ O
. _ O

In _ O
an _ O
analysis _ O
published _ O
earlier _ O
this _ O
year _ O
, _ O
the _ O
World _ O
Economic _ O
Forum _ O
predicted _ O
that _ O
India _ O
would _ O
have _ O
lifted _ O
2.5 _ O
crore _ O
more _ O
households _ O
out _ O
of _ O
poverty _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
decade _ O
, _ O
thereby _ O
reducing _ O
the _ O
share _ B-key
to _ O
households _ O
below _ O
the _ O
poverty _ O
line _ O
to _ O
5% _ O
. _ O

For _ O
a _ O
size _ O
of _ O
our _ O
country _ O
, _ O
these _ O
are _ O
staggering _ O
statistics _ O
and _ O
a _ O
harbinger _ O
of _ O
hope _ O
and _ O
optimism _ O
for _ O
the _ O
entire _ O
nation _ O
. _ O

Undoubtedly _ O
, _ O
there _ O
will _ O
be _ O
challenges _ O
and _ O
not _ O
all _ O
programmes _ O
may _ O
get _ O
executed _ O
to _ O
perfection _ O
but _ O
there _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
any _ O
denying _ O
the _ O
fact _ O
that _ O
the _ O
ambitions _ O
of _ O
our _ O
nation _ O
are _ O
taking _ O
shape _ O
in _ O
a _ O
fashion _ O
that _ O
is _ O
transformative _ O
and _ O
exciting _ O
and _ O
India _ O
is _ O
at _ O
an _ O
inflection _ O
point _ O
. _ O

The _ O
transformation _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Adani _ O
Group _ O
For _ O
the _ O
Adani _ O
Group _ O
, _ O
FY19 _ O
has _ O
also _ O
been _ O
a _ O
year _ O
of _ O
inflection _ O
. _ O

Each _ O
one _ O
of _ O
our _ O
six _ O
publicly _ O
traded _ O
Group _ O
companies _ O
delivered _ O
record _ O
financial _ B-key
performance _ I-key
and _ O
made _ O
tangible _ O
progress _ O
in _ O
further _ O
consolidating _ O
their _ O
individual _ O
positions _ O
as _ O
industry _ O
leaders _ O
in _ O
every _ O
segment _ O
we _ O
operate _ O
in _ O
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
context _ O
, _ O
it _ O
would _ O
be _ O
appropriate _ O
to _ O
mention _ O
the _ O
importance _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Central _ O
Electricity _ O

Commission _ O
’ _ O

. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
the _ O
largest _ O
challenge _ O
we _ O
had _ O
to _ O
overcome _ O
and _ O
is _ O
a _ O
reflection _ O
as _ O
much _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Group _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
tenacity _ O
to _ O
pursue _ O
what _ O
it _ O
believes _ O
is _ O
justified _ O
as _ O
much _ O
a _ O
reflection _ O
of _ O
the _ O
fairness _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
court _ O
systems _ O
. _ O

Every _ O

upon _ O

exist _ O
within _ O
the _ O

APSEZ _ O
leading _ O
from _ O
the _ O

APSEZ _ O
had _ O
a _ O
record _ O
year _ O
on _ O
multiple _ O
fronts _ O

It _ O
became _ O
the _ O
first _ O
Indian _ O
ports _ O
company _ O
to _ O
handle _ O
200 _ O
MMT _ O

the _ O
top _ O
five _ O

in _ O
the _ O

The _ O
most _ O
remarkable _ O
part _ O
of _ O
this _ O
narrative _ O
has _ O
been _ O
the _ O
acceleration _ O
witnessed _ O
over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
five _ O
years _ O
. _ O

It _ O
took _ O
APSEZ _ O
over _ O
a _ O

go _ O
from _ O
50 _ O

to _ O
100 _ O
