Message _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
The _ O
Power _ O
sector _ O
of _ O
India _ O
is _ O
going _ O
through _ O
a _ O
transformation _ B-key
phase _ O
with _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
government _ O
spending _ O
and _ O
emergence _ O
of _ O
renewable _ B-key
power _ I-key
energy _ I-key
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
with _ O
increasing _ O
power _ O
demand _ O
and _ O
evolution _ O
of _ O
renewable _ B-key
energy _ I-key
, _ O
thermal _ B-key
power _ I-key
energy _ I-key
remains _ O
a _ O
dominant _ O
aspect _ O
in _ O
sustaining _ O
the _ O
country _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
power _ O
requirements _ O
. _ O

As _ O
the _ O
government _ O
accelerates _ O
it _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
efforts _ O
to _ O
ensure _ O
last _ O
mile _ O
connectivity _ O
with _ O
power _ O
across _ O
the _ O
country _ O
, _ O
transmission _ O
sector _ O
remains _ O
crucial _ O
to _ O
achieve _ O
this _ O
objective _ O
. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
years _ O
, _ O
with _ O
rise _ O
in _ O
country _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
population _ O
and _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
, _ O
the _ O
power _ O
demand _ O
has _ O
increased _ O
continuously _ O
. _ O

The _ O
transmission _ O
sector _ O
is _ O
not _ O
only _ O
vital _ O
for _ O
the _ O
power _ O
generation _ O
companies _ O
but _ O
for _ O
distribution _ O
companies _ O
as _ O
well _ O
, _ O
as _ O
it _ O
plugs _ O
the _ O
gap _ O
with _ O
their _ O
infrastructure _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
past _ O
couple _ O
of _ O
years _ O
, _ O
an _ O
extensive _ O
network _ O
of _ O
transmission _ O
lines _ O
has _ O
been _ O
developed _ O
for _ O
evacuating _ O
power _ O
produced _ O
by _ O
different _ O
electricity _ O
generation _ O
stations _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
23,119 _ O
circuit _ O
kilometers _ O
of _ O
transmission _ B-key
lines _ I-key
were _ O
commissioned _ O
across _ O
the _ O
country _ O
. _ O

The _ O
total _ O
transmission _ O
lines _ O
in _ O
India _ O
stood _ O
at _ O
390,970 _ O
ckms _ O
as _ O
on _ O
31st _ O
March _ O
, _ O
2018 _ O
. _ O

A _ O
total _ O
of _ O
86,193 _ O
MVA _ O

MW _ O
capacity _ O
of _ O
substations _ O
were _ O
set _ O
up _ O
in _ O
2017 _ O

the _ O
total _ O

of _ O

in _ O

The _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
is _ O
planning _ O
to _ O
invest _ O
$2.15 _ O
billion _ O
for _ O
electrifying _ O
around _ O
4 _ O
Crore _ O
houses _ O
under _ O
the _ O
scheme _ O
‘ _ O
Saubhagya _ O

We _ O
increased _ O
our _ O
total _ O
transmission _ O
line _ O
length _ O
from _ O
5450 _ O
ckt _ O
kms _ O
to _ O
~ _ O
8600 _ O

With _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
our _ O
business _ O
we _ O
have _ O
increased _ O
our _ O

This _ O
will _ O
increase _ O
the _ O
demand _ O
for _ O

, _ O
and _ O

Moving _ O
ahead _ O
, _ O
India _ O
is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
cross _ O
400 _ O
GW _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
installed _ O
capacity _ O
by _ O
FY2022 _ O
, _ O
indicating _ O
that _ O
the _ O
country _ O
will _ O
witness _ O
a _ O
transition _ O
from _ O
current _ O
inter-regional _ O
transmission _ O
capacity _ O
of _ O
78 _ O
GW _ O
. _ O

Historically _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
power _ O
transmission _ O
sector _ O
has _ O
largely _ O
been _ O
dominated _ O
by _ O
the _ O
public _ O
sector _ O
. _ O

The _ O
spread _ O
of _ O
transmission _ O
grid _ O
widely _ O
and _ O
efficiently _ O
from _ O
power _ O
producers _ O
to _ O
distributors _ O
is _ O
still _ O
among _ O
the _ O
key _ O
factors _ O
that _ O
plagues _ O
the _ O
power _ O
sector _ O
. _ O

The _ O
current _ O
transmission _ O
network _ O
is _ O
not _ O
adequately _ O
set-up _ O
to _ O
transfer _ O
power _ O
from _ O
surplus _ O
parts _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
to _ O
deficit _ O
parts _ O
. _ O

This _ O
led _ O
to _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
number _ O
of _ O
private _ O
companies _ O
in _ O
this _ O
sector _ O
in _ O
recent _ O
past _ O
. _ O

It _ O
was _ O
an _ O
exciting _ O
time _ O
for _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
power _ O
sector _ O
when _ O
we _ O
entered _ O
the _ O
transmission _ O
business _ O
. _ O

In _ O
an _ O
era _ O
of _ O
transformation _ O
and _ O
rising _ O
power _ O
demand _ O
, _ O
we _ O
built _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
foundation _ O
of _ O
transmission _ O
network _ O
. _ O

At _ O
Adani _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
always _ O
believed _ O
in _ O
delivering _ O
excellence _ O
with _ O
industry _ O
changing _ O
innovation _ O
. _ O

We _ O
were _ O
the _ O
first _ O
private _ O
sector _ O
company _ O
to _ O
introduce _ O
HVDC _ O
utility _ O
in _ O
India _ O
. _ O

We _ O
invested _ O
towards _ O
setting _ O
up _ O
latest _ O
technologies _ O
and _ O
high _ O
voltage _ O
transmission _ B-key
lines _ I-key
to _ O
support _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
power _ B-key
transmission _ I-key
sector _ O
of _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
presence _ O
across _ O
key _ O
geographies _ O
has _ O
enabled _ O
us _ O
to _ O
capitalize _ O
on _ O
the _ O
emerging _ O
opportunities _ O
in _ O
those _ O
regions _ O
and _ O
expand _ O
our _ O
business _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
under _ O
review _ O
, _ O
we _ O
won _ O
another _ O
transmission _ O
projects _ O
through _ O
TBCB _ O
route _ O
and _ O
acquired _ O
two _ O
more _ O
transmission _ B-key
projects _ O
, _ O
that _ O
taking _ O
total _ O
transmission _ O
length _ O
from _ O
5450 _ O
ckt _ O
kms _ O
to _ O
~ _ O
8600 _ O
ckt _ O
kms _ O
. _ O

With _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
our _ O
business _ O
we _ O
have _ O
increased _ O
our _ O
cash _ O
and _ O

equivalents _ O
by _ O
69% _ O
in _ O
2017 _ O

. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
successfully _ O
recorded _ O
high _ O
system _ O
availability _ O
. _ O

This _ O
year _ O
also _ O
we _ O
have _ O
maintained _ O
our _ O
excellent _ O
operational _ O
capabilities _ O
and _ O
recorded _ O
a _ O
system _ O
availability _ O
level _ O
ranging _ O
from _ O
of _ O
99.83% _ O
to _ O
100% _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
we _ O
also _ O
initiated _ O
the _ O
acquisition _ O
of _ O
R _ O
Infra _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
Mumbai _ O
business _ O
, _ O
which _ O
we _ O
expect _ O
to _ O
be _ O
completed _ O
by _ O
June _ O
2018 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
acquisition _ O
will _ O
help _ O
us _ O
to _ O
expand _ O
our _ O
base _ O
in _ O
Mumbai _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
in _ O
B2C _ O
sector _ O
of _ O

it _ O

Their _ O
stability _ O
in _ O
financial _ O
performance _ O
with _ O
a _ O
RoE _ O
of _ O
16% _ O
provides _ O
us _ O
a _ O
platform _ O
for _ O
forward _ O
integration _ O
into _ O
retail _ O
power _ B-key
distribution _ I-key
sector _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Indian _ O
economy _ O
will _ O
experience _ O
sustained _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
the _ O
years _ O
to _ O
come _ O
, _ O
backed _ O
by _ O
encouraging _ O
reforms _ O

With _ O

push _ O
towards _ O
removing _ O
the _ O

in _ O
power _ B-key
generation _ I-key
and _ O

, _ O
the _ O

of _ O

experience _ O
growth _ O
in _ O

have _ O
some _ O
key _ O
projects _ O
under _ O
construction _ O
and _ O
expect _ O
them _ O
to _ O
be _ O
completed _ O
on _ O
schedule _ O

Similarly _ O
, _ O
the _ O
distribution _ O

will _ O
affect _ O
several _ O
opportunities _ O
to _ O

as _ O
it _ O
reforms _ O
