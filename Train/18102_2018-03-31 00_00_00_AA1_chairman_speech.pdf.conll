Dear _ O
Shareholders _ B-key
, _ O
I _ O
look _ O
back _ O
nearly _ O
35 _ O
years _ O
to _ O
when _ O
we _ O
initially _ O
set _ O
out _ O
to _ O
build _ O
the _ O
first _ O
corporate _ O
hospital _ O
, _ O
and _ O
then _ O
to _ O
the _ O
journey _ O
thereafter _ O
, _ O
in _ O
nurturing _ O
it _ O
into _ O
the _ O
world-class _ O
healthcare _ B-key
institution _ I-key
it _ O
has _ O
grown _ O
into _ O
today _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
motivation _ O
for _ O
the _ O
pursuit _ O
of _ O
our _ O
goals _ O
has _ O
not _ O
wavered _ O
a _ O
bit _ O
through _ O
this _ O
eventful _ O
and _ O
challenging _ O
journey _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
remained _ O
relentless _ O
during _ O
all _ O
this _ O
time _ O
in _ O
putting _ O
the _ O
patient _ O
at _ O
the _ O
core _ O
of _ O
all _ O
that _ O
we _ O
do _ O
, _ O
and _ O
bringing _ O
to _ O
them _ O
differentiated _ O
and _ O
loving _ O
care _ O
to _ O
alleviate _ O
the _ O
pain _ O
of _ O
illness _ O
and _ O
keep _ O
them _ O
well _ O
. _ O

Then _ O
, _ O
as _ O
now _ O
, _ O
we _ O
remain _ O
equally _ O
single _ O
minded _ O
in _ O
wanting _ O
to _ O
bridge _ O
the _ O
huge _ O
demand _ B-key
supply _ B-key
gap _ O
in _ O
India _ O
for _ O
quality _ O
hospitals _ O

by _ O

Our _ O

facing _ O
a _ O

in _ O

Current _ O
analyses _ O
suggest _ O
that _ O
by _ O

as _ O
many _ O
as _ O
300 _ O

million _ O
people _ O
will _ O
be _ O
at _ O

from _ O

, _ O
NCDs _ O
like _ O

account _ O

60% _ O

, _ O
26% _ O
of _ O

As _ O
a _ O

it _ O
is _ O
now _ O
time _ O
to _ O
go _ O
to _ O

that _ O

with _ O

the _ O

us _ O

in _ O
a _ O

of _ O
more _ O

where _ O
technology _ O
can _ O
be _ O

most _ O

to _ O

use _ O
