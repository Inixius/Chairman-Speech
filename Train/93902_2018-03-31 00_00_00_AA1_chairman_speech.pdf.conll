that _ O
the _ O

3.8% _ O

the _ O

over _ O

upsurge _ O
since _ O
CY10 _ O
as _ O
underlined _ O
by _ O
the _ O
IMF _ B-key
. _ O

This _ O
impetus _ O
from _ O
a _ O

further _ O
buoyed _ O
by _ O
a _ O
revival _ O
of _ O

is _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
continue _ O
. _ O

For _ O
the _ O
current _ O

the _ O
next _ O
year _ O
, _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
growth _ O
at _ O
3.9% _ O
is _ O
projected _ O
. _ O

This _ O

in _ O

the _ O

2018 _ O
’ _ O
study _ O
conducted _ O

named _ O
our _ O
Aditya _ O
Birla _ O
Group _ O
as _ O
the _ O
‘ _ O
Best _ O

in _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Moving _ O
on _ O
to _ O
our _ O
people _ O
processes _ O
, _ O
what _ O
strikes _ O
me _ O
most _ O
is _ O
that _ O
the _ O
development _ O
and _ O
leadership _ B-key
aspects _ O
embedded _ O
in _ O
them _ O
are _ O
all _ O
futuristic _ O
. _ O

I _ O
believe _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
headed _ O
in _ O
the _ O
right _ O
direction _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
me _ O
give _ O
you _ O
a _ O
flavour _ O
of _ O
what _ O
we _ O
have _ O
accomplished _ O
and _ O
how _ O
we _ O
are _ O
constantly _ O
refreshing _ O
and _ O
reengineering _ O
our _ O
HR _ O
initiatives _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
Group _ O
HR _ O
has _ O
formulated _ O
a _ O
unique _ O
proposition _ O
for _ O
leadership _ B-key
development _ O
through _ O
the _ O
2x2x2 _ O
formula _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
structured _ O
in _ O
a _ O
manner _ O
that _ O
accords _ O
opportunities _ O
to _ O
high _ O
talent _ O
to _ O
work _ O
in _ O
two _ O
businesses _ O
across _ O
two _ O
geographies _ O
and _ O
in _ O
two _ O
functions _ O
. _ O

Such _ O
an _ O
approach _ O
should _ O
give _ O
a _ O
holistic _ O
experience _ O
and _ O
help _ O
prepare _ O
our _ O
future _ O
leaders _ O
. _ O

I _ O
had _ O
apprised _ O
you _ O
earlier _ O
on _ O
the _ O
talent _ O
councils _ O
led _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Business _ O
Heads _ O
and _ O
Directors _ O
at _ O
the _ O
Group _ O
, _ O
business _ O
and _ O
at _ O
the _ O
functional _ O
levels _ O
. _ O

So _ O
far _ O
, _ O
more _ O
than _ O
250 _ O
talent _ O
council _ O
meetings _ O
have _ O
been _ O
held _ O
with _ O
over _ O
8,000 _ O
development _ O
conversations _ O
and _ O
actions _ O
initiated _ O
for _ O
these _ O
colleagues _ O
. _ O

I _ O
have _ O
attended _ O
several _ O
of _ O
these _ O
meetings _ O
and _ O
am _ O
much _ O
encouraged _ O
by _ O
the _ O
positivity _ O
and _ O
enthusiasm _ O
they _ O
generate _ O
among _ O
employees _ O
down _ O
the _ O
line _ O
. _ O

They _ O
rightly _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
talent _ O
will _ O
always _ O
bubble _ O
to _ O
the _ O
top _ O
. _ O

More _ O
than _ O
ever _ O
before _ O
, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
people _ O
domain _ O

segments _ O

have _ O
grabbed _ O
