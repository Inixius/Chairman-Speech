During _ O
the _ O

, _ O
we _ O
launched _ O
our _ O

Group _ O

identity _ O
. _ O

Elucidated _ O
through _ O
the _ O
tagline _ O
, _ O
‘ _ O

Everyday _ O
’ _ O
, _ O
our _ O

the _ O

at _ O

And _ O
we _ O
do _ O
so _ O
by _ O
following _ O
the _ O
principle _ O
of _ O
bettering _ O
ourselves _ O
, _ O
time _ O

again _ O
, _ O
continuously _ O

a _ O
personality _ O
that _ O

borrows _ O
from _ O
the _ O
actions _ O
and _ O

we _ O
have _ O
demonstrated _ O

In _ O

we _ O
find _ O
resonance _ O
of _ O
‘ _ O

and _ O
in _ O
the _ O
strategic _ B-key
focus _ O

We _ O

The _ O

saw _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
rebound _ O
in _ O

, _ O
especially _ O
in _ O
the _ O
second _ O

, _ O
demonstrating _ O
a _ O
healthy _ O

to _ O

India _ O
’ _ O

such _ O

and _ O
broad-based _ O

such _ O
as _ O
relaxation _ O
of _ O

, _ O

of _ O
the _ O
IBC _ O
and _ O

stemming _ O
from _ O

For _ O
the _ O

time _ O
in _ O
many _ O
years _ O
, _ O
elasticity _ O
of _ O
steel _ O
demand _ O
to _ O

exceeded _ O
1x _ O

Infrastructure _ O
received _ O
a _ O
big _ O
boost _ O
in _ O
the _ O
form _ O
of _ O
budgetary _ B-key
allocation _ O
, _ O
and _ O
consumer _ O
sentiment _ O
too _ O
is _ O
on _ O
the _ O
rise _ O
. _ O

We _ O
also _ O
crossed _ O
the _ O
GDP _ O
threshold _ O
of _ O
US _ O
$2.5 _ O
trillion _ O
, _ O
and _ O
with _ O
a _ O
likely _ O

, _ O
the _ O
medium _ O
to _ O
long-term _ O
outlook _ O
for _ O

growth _ O
is _ O
very _ O
positive _ O
. _ O

In _ O
addition _ O
, _ O
the _ O
introduction _ O
of _ O
GST _ O
is _ O
a _ O
seminal _ O
reform _ O
, _ O
which _ O
will _ O
help _ O
formalise _ O
the _ O
economy _ B-key
, _ O
introduce _ O
transparency _ O
and _ O
go _ O
a _ O
long _ O
way _ O
in _ O
creating _ O
a _ O
level-playing _ O
field _ O
, _ O
besides _ O
weeding _ O
out _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
of _ O
tertiary _ O
inefficiencies _ O
. _ O

We _ O
view _ O
this _ O
very _ O
positively _ O
. _ O

Of _ O

importance _ O
are _ O
the _ O

that _ O
quality _ O

will _ O
converge _ O
to _ O
make _ O

of _ O

the _ O

that _ O
are _ O
financially _ O

Setting _ O
new _ O
milestones _ O
JSW _ O
Steel _ O
achieved _ O
a _ O
record _ O
performance _ O
in _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

With _ O
an _ O
all-time _ O
high _ O
crude _ O
steel _ O
production _ B-key
, _ O
our _ O
shipments _ O
remained _ O
buoyant _ O
. _ O

Revival _ O
in _ O
domestic _ O
demand _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
second _ O
half _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
was _ O
a _ O
key _ O
catalyst _ O
of _ O
our _ O
performance _ O
and _ O
was _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
improving _ O
prospects _ O
of _ O
the _ O
auto _ O

and _ O
capital _ B-key

Rising _ O
share _ B-key
of _ O
value-added _ O
and _ O
special _ O
products _ O
in _ O
the _ O
overall _ O
business _ O
was _ O
another _ O
highlight _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

These _ O
products _ O
accounted _ O
for _ O
58% _ O
of _ O
our _ O
shipments _ O
in _ O
FY _ O
2017 _ O
- _ O
18 _ O
and _ O
were _ O
instrumental _ O
in _ O
boosting _ O
our _ O
realisations _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
profitability _ B-key
. _ O

Our _ O
domestic _ O
sales _ B-key
volume _ O
growth _ O
at _ O
9% _ O
surpassed _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
consumption _ O
growth _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Thus _ O
, _ O
we _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
further _ O
consolidate _ O
our _ O
leadership _ O
position _ O
in _ O
the _ O
market _ B-key
. _ O

Our _ O
relentless _ O

Deleveraging _ O

out _ O

This _ O

our _ O

blueprint _ O
for _ O
the _ O
US _ O
market _ O
, _ O
to _ O
produce _ O
American _ O
melted _ O
and _ O
manufactured _ O
steel _ O
with _ O
a _ O
total _ O
capacity _ O
of _ O
4 _ O
MTPA _ O

to _ O
upto _ O

Similarly _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
the _ O
process _ O
of _ O
acquiring _ O
the _ O
rolling _ O
facilities _ O
of _ O
Italian _ O
steelmaker _ O
, _ O
Aferpi _ O
( _ O

Lucchini _ O
) _ O
, _ O
with _ O
a _ O
capacity _ O
of _ O
1.3 _ O
MTPA _ O
for _ O
about _ O
Euro _ O
55 _ O
million _ O
. _ O

Through _ O
this _ O
acquisition _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
will _ O
get _ O
a _ O
stronger _ O
foothold _ O
in _ O
the _ O
European _ O
market _ O
and _ O
can _ O
swiftly _ O
tap _ O
into _ O
the _ O
emerging _ O
opportunities _ O
in _ O
the _ O
continent _ O
. _ O

Needless _ O
to _ O
mention _ O
, _ O
while _ O
pursuing _ O
all _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
opportunities _ O
– _ O
whether _ O
organic _ O
or _ O
inorganic _ O
– _ O
we _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
demonstrate _ O
prudence _ O
and _ O
follow _ O
conservative _ O
financial _ B-key
policies _ O
. _ O

Favourable _ O
policy _ O
environment _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
has _ O
put _ O
in _ O
place _ O
multiple _ O
policy _ O
measures _ O
to _ O
support _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

Be _ O
it _ O
long-term _ O
measures _ O
like _ O
the _ O
National _ O
Steel _ O
Policy _ O
2017 _ O
, _ O
which _ O
aims _ O
to _ O
make _ O
India _ O
a _ O
competitive _ O
and _ O
self-sufficient _ O
steel _ O
producing _ O
country _ O
by _ O
2030 _ O
; _ O
or _ O
shorter-term _ O
trade _ O
remedial _ O
measures _ O
intended _ O
to _ O
provide _ O
a _ O
level _ O
playing _ O
field _ O
for _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
companies _ O
. _ O

The _ O
government _ O
has _ O
been _ O
rather _ O
proactive _ O
to _ O
mitigate _ O
the _ O
serious _ O
injury _ O
caused _ O
to _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
industry _ O
due _ O
to _ O
unfair _ O
trade _ O
. _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
these _ O
measures _ O
could _ O
lead _ O
to _ O
healthy _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
over _ O
7% _ O
in _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
industry _ O
over _ O
the _ O
medium _ O
term _ O
. _ O

Against _ O
this _ O
backdrop _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
make _ O
the _ O
requisite _ O
investments _ B-key
needed _ O
to _ O
grow _ O
responsibly _ O

of _ O
around _ O
7% _ O
p.a _ O
. _ O
for _ O
the _ O
overall _ O
steel _ O

, _ O
India _ O
will _ O
need _ O
to _ O
create _ O
over _ O
150 _ O
million _ O

capacity _ O
in _ O
the _ O

As _ O

from _ O
18 _ O
MTPA _ O

to _ O
24.7 _ O
MTPA _ O
by _ O

Limiting _ O
the _ O

Global _ B-key
economies _ I-key
are _ O
increasingly _ O
stepping _ O
up _ O
protectionist _ O
trade _ O
measures _ O
to _ O
safeguard _ O
the _ O
interest _ B-key
of _ O

While _ O
this _ O

could _ O
continue _ O
in _ O

it _ O
will _ O
not _ O
hinder _ O
our _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
the _ O
international _ B-key
markets _ I-key
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
because _ O
we _ O
have _ O
selectively _ O
pursued _ O
some _ O
value-accretive _ O
acquisitions _ O
in _ O
the _ O
overseas _ O
markets _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
with _ O
the _ O
objective _ O
of _ O
replicating _ O
our _ O
low _ B-key
capital _ I-key

model _ I-key
in _ O
a _ O
relatively _ O
higher _ O
operating _ B-key

environment _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O

we _ O
have _ O
signed _ O
a _ O
Memorandum _ O
of _ O
Co-operation _ O
to _ O
consider _ O
investment _ B-key
of _ O
up _ O
to _ O
US _ O
$500 _ O

( _ O

in _ O
Baytown _ O

These _ O
investments _ B-key
are _ O
directed _ O
towards _ O
capability _ O
enhancement _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Baytown _ O
facility _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
a _ O

to _ O
set _ O

Additionally _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
recently _ O
acquired _ O
an _ O
