Message _ O
from _ O
the _ O
CEO _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
I _ O
write _ O
this _ O
at _ O
a _ O
time _ O
when _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
the _ O
midst _ O
of _ O
the _ O
COVID _ O
- _ O
19 _ O
pandemic _ O
. _ O

My _ O
sympathies _ O
are _ O
with _ O
anyone _ O
who _ O
is _ O
directly _ O
or _ O
indirectly _ O
affected _ O
by _ O
the _ O
virus _ O
and _ O
I _ O
sincerely _ O
wish _ O
for _ O
the _ O
good _ O
health _ O
and _ O
safety _ O
of _ O
all _ O
. _ O

Apart _ O
from _ O
the _ O
health _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ O
has _ O
also _ O
presented _ O
us _ O
with _ O
an _ O
economic _ O
crisis _ O
. _ O

Across _ O
countries _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
witnessed _ O
a _ O
sharp _ O
deceleration _ O
in _ O
growth _ O
, _ O
with _ O
airlines _ O
being _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
worst _ O
hit _ O
sectors _ O
. _ O

FY _ O
2020 _ O
has _ O
therefore _ O
been _ O
a _ O
challenging _ O
year _ O
for _ O
us _ O
, _ O
primarily _ O
due _ O
to _ O
this _ O
outbreak _ O
. _ O

Both _ O
internationally _ O
and _ O
domestically _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
faced _ O
unprecedented _ O
demand _ O
slowdown _ O
and _ O
revenue _ B-key
challenges _ O
due _ O
to _ O
travel _ O
bans _ O
, _ O
lockdowns _ O
and _ O
general _ O
anxiety _ O
towards _ O
travel _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
the _ O
level _ O
of _ O
resilience _ O
and _ O
determination _ O
that _ O
our _ O
organisation _ O
has _ O
demonstrated _ O
is _ O
really _ O
commendable _ O
. _ O

As _ O
an _ O
example _ O
, _ O
during _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ O
, _ O
our _ O
entire _ O
operations _ O
and _ O
sales _ O
teams _ O
worked _ O
together _ O
to _ O
rapidly _ O
convert _ O
some _ O
of _ O
our _ O
aircraft _ O
from _ O
passenger _ O
aircraft _ O
to _ O
all-cargo _ O
aircraft _ O
. _ O

Consequently _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
carrying _ O
up _ O
to _ O
twenty _ O
tons _ O
of _ O
cargo _ O
on _ O
passenger _ O
airplanes _ O
to _ O
destinations _ O
in _ O
Asia _ O
and _ O
the _ O
Middle _ O
East _ O
. _ O

We _ O
deeply _ O
appreciate _ O
the _ O
support _ O
we _ O
are _ O
receiving _ O
from _ O
our _ O
stakeholders _ O
during _ O
this _ O
time _ O
. _ O

Given _ O
the _ O
uncertainty _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
difficult _ O
to _ O
predict _ O
the _ O
timing _ O
of _ O
return _ O
to _ O
normalcy _ O
, _ O
but _ O
we _ O
are _ O
determined _ O
to _ O
come _ O
out _ O
of _ O
this _ O
crisis _ O
in _ O
a _ O
stronger _ O
position _ O
than _ O
when _ O
we _ O
entered _ O
. _ O

In _ O
that _ O
context _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
paying _ O
particular _ O
attention _ O
to _ O
four _ O
critical _ O
aspects _ O
of _ O
our _ O
company _ O
including _ O
measures _ O
to _ O
ensure _ O
the _ O
safety _ O
of _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
and _ O
employees _ O
, _ O
reduce _ O
our _ O
costs _ O
, _ O
strengthen _ O
our _ O
brand _ O
and _ O
further _ O
enhance _ O
our _ O
employee _ O
culture _ O
. _ O

Priority _ O
to _ O
customer _ O
safety _ O
and _ O
well-being _ O
At _ O
this _ O
time _ O
, _ O
our _ O
priority _ O
is _ O
to _ O
ensure _ O
safety _ O
of _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
introduced _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
measures _ O
as _ O
a _ O
part _ O
of _ O
our _ O
new _ O
standard _ O
operating _ O
procedures _ O
, _ O
which _ O
will _ O
enable _ O
us _ O
to _ O
minimise _ O
the _ O
impact _ O
of _ O
the _ O
virus _ O
. _ O

Some _ O
of _ O
these _ O
procedures _ O
include _ O
: _ O
• _ O
Disinfecting _ O
aircraft _ O
before _ O
every _ O
departure _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Spray _ O
cleaning _ O
the _ O
aircraft _ O
at _ O
every _ O
arrival _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Increased _ O
frequency _ O
of _ O
deep _ O
cleaning _ O
of _ O
the _ O
aircraft _ O
including _ O
wiping _ O
of _ O
all _ O
touch _ O
points _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Providing _ O
safety _ O
kits _ O
to _ O
our _ O
passengers _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Mandatory _ O
masks _ O
on _ O
board _ O
for _ O
both _ O
crew _ O
and _ O
passengers _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Placing _ O
hand _ O
sanitisers _ O
at _ O
various _ O
places _ O
; _ O
• _ O
Discontinuance _ O
of _ O
meal _ O

from _ O
the _ O
CEO _ O
Further _ O
, _ O
Airbus _ O
aircraft _ O
cabin _ O
is _ O
equipped _ O
with _ O
HEPA _ O
filters _ O
, _ O
which _ O
ensures _ O
that _ O
the _ O
virus _ O
cannot _ O
recirculate _ O
. _ O

The _ O
surfaces _ O
are _ O
cleaned _ O
thoroughly _ O
and _ O
passengers _ O
are _ O
wearing _ O
face _ O
masks _ O
. _ O

So _ O
the _ O
risk _ O
of _ O
transmission _ O
by _ O
air _ O
or _ O
through _ O
droplets _ O
is _ O
minimal _ O
. _ O

Therefore _ O
, _ O
I _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
stress _ O
that _ O
airlines _ O
are _ O
clearly _ O
the _ O
safest _ O
mode _ O
of _ O
transportation _ B-key
and _ O
we _ O
want _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
to _ O
fly _ O
our _ O
airline _ O
with _ O
full _ O
confidence _ O
that _ O
we _ O
are _ O
safeguarding _ O
their _ O
health _ O
and _ O
well-being _ O
. _ O

Low _ O
costs _ O
remain _ O
fundamental _ O
to _ O
the _ O
way _ O
we _ O
do _ O
business _ O
IndiGo _ O
is _ O
a _ O
pioneer _ O
in _ O
bringing _ O
low-cost _ O
aviation _ O
to _ O
India _ O
. _ O

With _ O
our _ O
structural _ O
cost _ O
advantages _ O
coupled _ O
with _ O
operational _ O
efficiencies _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
build _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
lowest _ O
cost _ O
structures _ O
globally _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
current _ O
period _ O
of _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
when _ O
revenue _ O
has _ O
nearly _ O
dried _ O
up _ O
, _ O
airlines _ O
across _ O
the _ O
globe _ O
are _ O
emphasising _ O
cost _ O
control _ O
and _ O
reduction _ O
of _ O
cash _ O
burn _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
also _ O
undertaken _ O
several _ O
cost _ O
reduction _ O
and _ O
cash _ O
flow _ O
initiatives _ O
that _ O
have _ O
helped _ O
us _ O
to _ O
rationalise _ B-key
our _ O
costs _ O
further _ O
and _ O
utilise _ O
our _ O
cash _ O
reserves _ O
judiciously _ O
. _ O

Specifically _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
taken _ O
the _ O
following _ O
actions _ O
: _ O
• _ O
We _ O
have _ O
announced _ O
a _ O
salary _ O
cut _ O
in _ O
the _ O
range _ O
of _ O
5 _ O
to _ O
25% _ O
across _ O
the _ O
organisation _ O
excluding _ O
certain _ O
employees _ O
at _ O
the _ O
lower _ O
pay _ O
grades _ O

. _ O

• _ O
We _ O
have _ O
announced _ O
leave _ O
without _ O
pay _ O
for _ O
the _ O
months _ O
of _ O
May _ O
, _ O
June _ O
and _ O
July _ O
. _ O

This _ O
action _ O
will _ O
result _ O
in _ O
employees _ O
foregoing _ O
an _ O
additional _ O
3% _ O
to _ O
17% _ O
of _ O
their _ O
pay _ O

. _ O

• _ O
We _ O
have _ O
put _ O
on _ O
hold _ O
all _ O
discretionary _ O
expenses _ O
and _ O
have _ O
deferred _ O
certain _ O
capital _ B-key
expenditure _ I-key
projects _ O

. _ O

• _ O
We _ O
are _ O
looking _ O
at _ O
every _ O
element _ O
of _ O
cost _ O
and _ O
working _ O
hard _ O
with _ O
the _ O
partners _ O
for _ O
negotiating _ O
better _ O
prices _ O
and _ O
terms _ O

. _ O

• _ O
We _ O
will _ O
be _ O
rightsizing _ O
our _ O
capacity _ O
to _ O
the _ O
demand _ O
in _ O
the _ O
market _ O
. _ O

We _ O
value _ O
the _ O
efficiency _ O
and _ O
structural _ O
low _ O
costs _ O
associated _ O
with _ O
NEO _ O
aircraft _ O
and _ O
thus _ O
we _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
substitute _ O
them _ O
for _ O
the _ O
older _ O
CEO _ O
aircraft _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
taking _ O
deliveries _ O
of _ O
all _ O
our _ O
new _ O
NEO _ O
aircraft _ O
and _ O
balancing _ O
them _ O
by _ O
returning _ O
the _ O
CEO _ O
aircraft _ O
that _ O
we _ O
had _ O
committed _ O
to _ O
earlier _ O
. _ O

Overview _ O
Reports _ O
Financials _ O
Our _ O
focus _ O
has _ O
shifted _ O
from _ O
profitability _ O
and _ O
growth _ O
to _ O
cash _ O
management _ O
and _ O
liquidity _ O
This _ O
crisis _ O
has _ O
once _ O
again _ O
highlighted _ O
the _ O
importance _ O
of _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
balance _ O
sheet _ O
, _ O
particularly _ O
, _ O
our _ O
cash _ O
reserves _ O
. _ O

In _ O
times _ O
of _ O
distress _ O
, _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
cash _ O
balance _ O
built _ O
up _ O
prudently _ O
over _ O
the _ O
years _ O
has _ O
provided _ O
IndiGo _ O
with _ O
a _ O
cushion _ O
to _ O
navigate _ O
through _ O
these _ O
difficult _ O
times _ O
. _ O

As _ O
a _ O
result _ O
, _ O
we _ O
ended _ O
the _ O
FY _ O
2020 _ O
with _ O
a _ O
healthy _ O
total _ O
cash _ O
balance _ O
of _ O
204 _ O
billion _ O
rupees _ O
of _ O
which _ O
89 _ O
billion _ O
rupees _ O
was _ O
free _ O
cash _ O
. _ O

Along _ O
with _ O
this _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
taken _ O
and _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
take _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
actions _ O
to _ O
shore _ O
up _ O
our _ O
liquidity _ O
. _ O

In _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
liquidity _ O
measures _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
working _ O
on _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
initiatives _ O
such _ O
as _ O
: _ O
• _ O
Returning _ O
older _ O
CEOs _ O
and _ O
getting _ O
deliveries _ O
of _ O
NEOs _ O
: _ O
The _ O
CEOs _ O
that _ O
we _ O
are _ O
operating _ O
have _ O
a _ O
higher _ O
ownership _ O
cost _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
higher _ O
maintenance _ O
cost _ O
and _ O
higher _ O
fuel _ O
burn _ O
. _ O

As _ O
part _ O
of _ O
our _ O
fleet _ O
plan _ O
we _ O
are _ O
working _ O
on _ O
naturally _ O
retiring _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
these _ O
CEO _ O
aircraft _ O
. _ O

We _ O
will _ O
be _ O
taking _ O
the _ O
deliveries _ O
of _ O
new _ O
planes _ O
in _ O
quarter _ O
1 _ O
and _ O
2 _ O
of _ O
FY _ O
2021 _ O
which _ O
are _ O
more _ O

effective _ O
and _ O
we _ O
are _ O
in _ O
discussions _ O
with _ O
manufacturers _ O
regarding _ O
deliveries _ O
beyond _ O
this _ O
period _ O
. _ O

Further _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
already _ O
financed _ O
majority _ O
of _ O
the _ O
deliveries _ O
through _ O
operating _ O
lessors _ O
, _ O
which _ O
will _ O
help _ O
in _ O
improving _ O
our _ O
liquidity _ O

. _ O

• _ O
Freezing _ O
of _ O
supplementary _ O
rentals _ O
: _ O
We _ O
have _ O
been _ O
talking _ O
to _ O
our _ O
lessors _ O
to _ O
freeze _ O
our _ O
supplementary _ O
rentals _ B-key
and _ O
better _ O
align _ O
these _ O
with _ O
our _ O
utilisation _ O
for _ O
a _ O
period _ O
of _ O
9 _ O
months _ O
. _ O

Since _ O
a _ O
large _ O
number _ O
of _ O

are _ O
currently _ O
grounded _ O
and _ O
will _ O
be _ O
operated _ O
at _ O
much _ O
lower _ O
utilisation _ O
levels _ O
going _ O
forward _ O
, _ O
there _ O
is _ O
no _ O
immediate _ O
need _ O
for _ O
us _ O
to _ O
provide _ O
for _ O
these _ O

. _ O

• _ O
We _ O
have _ O
reached _ O
out _ O
to _ O
our _ O
various _ O
suppliers _ O
to _ O
provide _ O
us _ O
more _ O
favourable _ O
credit _ O
terms _ O

• _ O
Moreover _ O
, _ O
while _ O
we _ O
have _ O
paid _ O

in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
, _ O
we _ O
will _ O
not _ O
pay _ O
dividends _ B-key
this _ O
year _ O
to _ O
conserve _ O
liquidity _ B-key
. _ O

All _ O
these _ O
measures _ O
will _ O
help _ O
us _ O
generate _ O
additional _ O
liquidity _ O
of _ O
approximately _ O
30 _ O

40 _ O
billion _ O

In _ O
the _ O

of _ O
every _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
lies _ O
great _ O
opportunity _ O
” _ O
The _ O
pandemic _ O
has _ O
presented _ O
several _ O
challenges _ O
to _ O
the _ O
aviation _ O
industry _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
liquidity _ O
and _ O
change _ O
in _ O
consumer _ O
expectations _ O
. _ O

Even _ O
with _ O
these _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
I _ O
am _ O
very _ O
bullish _ O
on _ O
the _ O
future _ O
of _ O
Indian _ O
aviation _ O
, _ O
as _ O
India _ O
possesses _ O
all _ O
the _ O
underlying _ O
drivers _ O
required _ O
for _ O
rapid _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
this _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

Furthermore _ O
, _ O
I _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
IndiGo _ O
is _ O
best _ O
placed _ O
to _ O
lead _ O
this _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
Indian _ O
aviation _ O
given _ O
its _ O
financial _ B-key
strength _ I-key
, _ O
efficient _ B-key
fleet _ I-key
and _ O
strong _ O
market _ O
position _ O
across _ O
India _ O
and _ O
neighbouring _ O
countries _ O
. _ O

I _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
sum _ O
up _ O
by _ O
saying _ O
that _ O
IndiGo _ O
is _ O
likely _ O
to _ O
soon _ O
resume _ O
its _ O
path _ O
of _ O
rapid _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
imperative _ O
for _ O
us _ O
to _ O
remain _ O
focused _ O
on _ O
liquidity _ O
and _ O
profitability _ O
with _ O
no _ O
compromise _ O
on _ O

excellence _ O
