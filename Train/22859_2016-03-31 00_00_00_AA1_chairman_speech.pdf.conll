Year _ O
2015 _ O
- _ O
16 _ O
has _ O
been _ O
another _ O
challenging _ O
and _ O
fulfilling _ O
year _ O
for _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
and _ O
it _ O
gives _ O
me _ O
great _ O
pleasure _ O
to _ O
apprise _ O
you _ O
of _ O
the _ O
key _ O
highlights _ O
of _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
performance _ O
in _ O
this _ O
period _ O
. _ O

The _ O
domestic _ B-key
economy _ I-key
started _ O
the _ O
year _ O
in _ O
an _ O
enviable _ O
sweet _ O
spot _ O
with _ O
favorable _ O
sentiments _ O
buoyed _ O
by _ O
the _ O
strong _ O
political _ O
mandate _ O
at _ O
the _ O
Centre _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
by _ O
the _ O
favorable _ O
external _ O
environment _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
political _ O
front _ O
, _ O
while _ O
much _ O
of _ O
the _ O
expected _ O
big _ O
reforms _ O
didn _ O
’ _ O
t _ O
materialize _ O
, _ O
the _ O
incremental _ O
reform _ O
agenda _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
seems _ O
to _ O
be _ O
pushing _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
forward _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
external _ O
front _ O
, _ O
India _ O
gained _ O
the _ O
maximum _ O
out _ O
of _ O
the _ O
declining _ O
crude _ O
oil _ O
prices _ O
and _ O
this _ O
helped _ O
reign _ O
in _ O
the _ O
inflation _ B-key
trend _ O
in _ O
the _ O
economy _ B-key
. _ O

The _ O
external _ O
position _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
also _ O
improved _ O
and _ O
this _ O
was _ O
visible _ O
in _ O
the _ O
improving _ O
fiscal _ O
and _ O
current _ O
account _ O
deficit _ O
numbers _ O
for _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
volatile _ O
global _ B-key
economic _ I-key
conditions _ I-key
, _ O
though _ O
, _ O
highlighted _ O
the _ O
strong _ O
inter-linkage _ O
of _ O
the _ O
domestic _ B-key
economy _ I-key
with _ O
the _ O
external _ O
world _ O
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
reflected _ O
in _ O
the _ O
drop _ O
in _ O
trade _ B-key
exports _ I-key
on _ O
the _ O
back _ O
of _ O
below-normal _ O
growth _ O
conditions _ O
prevalent _ O
in _ O
most _ O
part _ O
of _ O
the _ O
world _ O
thereby _ O
keeping _ O
the _ O
manufacturing _ O
activity _ O
subdued _ O
for _ O
most _ O
part _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

As _ O
a _ O
result _ O
, _ O
while _ O
at _ O
an _ O
overall _ O
level _ O
, _ O
the _ O
domestic _ B-key
economy _ I-key
continued _ O
to _ O
be _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
fastest _ O
growing _ O
large _ B-key
economies _ I-key
, _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
has _ O
been _ O
below _ O
the _ O
potential _ O
rate _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
below _ O
the _ O
expectations _ O
set _ O
at _ O
the _ O
start _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Against _ O
this _ O
challenging _ O
backdrop _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
did _ O
well _ O
to _ O
grow _ O
its _ O
various _ O
business _ O
segments _ O
. _ O

Compared _ O
to _ O
a _ O
lackluster _ O
first _ O
half _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
did _ O
well _ O
in _ O
the _ O
second _ O
half _ O
aided _ O
by _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
festival _ O
season _ O
period _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
input _ O
side _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
benefited _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
on _ O
account _ O
of _ O
the _ O
declining _ O
raw _ O
material _ O
prices _ O
and _ O
a _ O
part _ O
of _ O
this _ O
benefit _ O
was _ O
passed _ O
on _ O
to _ O
the _ O
customers _ O
through _ O
a _ O
price _ O
revision _ O
towards _ O
the _ O
end _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Your _ O
Company _ O
took _ O
various _ O
measures _ O
on _ O

the _ O
positioning _ O
and _ O
range _ O
of _ O

and _ O
services _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
to _ O
reinforce _ O
its _ O
leadership _ O
position _ O
in _ O
the _ O
market _ O
. _ O

Continuing _ O
with _ O
its _ O
agenda _ O
to _ O
expand _ O
offerings _ O
beyond _ O
the _ O
traditional _ O
paint _ B-key
products _ I-key
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
entered _ O
the _ O
retail _ B-key
segment _ I-key
of _ O
the _ O
adhesives _ O
category _ O
with _ O
a _ O
distribution _ O
arrangement _ O
with _ O
Henkel _ O
Adhesives _ O

, _ O

to _ O
sell _ O
the _ O
Loctite _ O
brand _ O
of _ O
adhesives _ O
under _ O
a _ O
co-branding _ O
initiative _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
International _ O
business _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
got _ O
a _ O
fillip _ O
from _ O
the _ O
acquisition _ O
in _ O
Ethiopia _ O
. _ O

Operations _ O
in _ O
Ethiopia _ O
contributed _ O
significantly _ O
to _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
the _ O
international _ O
business _ O
and _ O
