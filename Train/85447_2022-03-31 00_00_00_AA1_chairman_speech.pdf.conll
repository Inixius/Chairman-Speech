CHAIRMAN _ O
’ _ O
S _ O
LETTER _ O
TO _ O
SHAREHOLDERS _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
For _ O
many _ O
years _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
talking _ O
about _ O
increasing _ O
volatility _ O
and _ O
unpredictability _ O
. _ O

The _ O
events _ O
of _ O
the _ O
last _ O
24 _ O
months _ O
have _ O
heralded _ O
a _ O
new _ O
era _ O
of _ O
uncertainty _ O
where _ O
both _ O
the _ O
amplitude _ O
and _ O
frequency _ O
of _ O
shifts _ O
have _ O
vastly _ O
exceeded _ O
anything _ O
we _ O
have _ O
seen _ O
in _ O
recent _ O
decades _ O
. _ O

The _ O
unprecedented _ O
pandemic _ O
was _ O
followed _ O
by _ O
supply _ B-key
chain _ I-key
whiplash _ O
, _ O
and _ O
further _ O
disruption _ O
was _ O
brought _ O
on _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Russia-Ukraine _ B-key
war _ I-key
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
now _ O
staring _ O
at _ O
the _ O
spectre _ O
of _ O
a _ O
high-interest _ B-key
rate _ I-key
and _ O
high-inflation _ O
regime _ O
globally _ O
. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
years _ O
, _ O
corporations _ O
have _ O
tried _ O
to _ O
find _ O
a _ O
balance _ O
between _ O
efficiency _ O
and _ O
resilience _ O
, _ O
with _ O
successive _ O
decades _ O
of _ O
growth _ O
having _ O
swung _ O
the _ O
pendulum _ O
in _ O
the _ O
direction _ O
of _ O
efficiency _ O
. _ O

The _ O
events _ O
of _ O
the _ O
last _ O
two _ O
years _ O
have _ O
once _ O
again _ O
taught _ O
us _ O
all _ O
the _ O
virtues _ O
of _ O
reserves _ O
and _ O
resilience _ O
. _ O

This _ O
era _ O
of _ O
disruption _ O
also _ O
presents _ O
a _ O
unique _ O
opportunity _ O
for _ O
renewal _ O
. _ O

The _ O
exigencies _ B-key
of _ O
this _ O
disruption _ O
have _ O
pushed _ O
the _ O
boundaries _ O
of _ O
innovation _ B-key
. _ O

A _ O
world _ O
that _ O
freed _ O
thinking _ O
from _ O
its _ O
conventional _ O
shackles _ O
. _ O

And _ O
we _ O
are _ O
clearly _ O
staring _ O
at _ O
a _ O
new _ O
age _ O
, _ O
with _ O
new _ O
paradigms _ O
and _ O
new _ B-key
ideas _ I-key
. _ O

GLOBAL _ B-key
ECONOMY _ I-key
: _ O
THE _ O
STORM _ O
BEFORE _ O
THE _ O
CALM _ O
? _ O

The _ O
global _ B-key
economy _ I-key
recovered _ O
from _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ B-key
shock _ O
in _ O
2022 _ O
on _ O
the _ O
back _ O
of _ O
supportive _ O
fiscal _ O
and _ O
monetary _ B-key
policies _ I-key
and _ O
mass _ O
vaccination _ O
programmes _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
at _ O
the _ O
end _ O
of _ O
FY22 _ O
, _ O
the _ O
war _ O
in _ O
Ukraine _ O
and _ O
the _ O
subsequent _ O
economic _ B-key
sanctions _ O
on _ O
Russia _ O
posed _ O
several _ O
challenges _ O
. _ O

It _ O
disrupted _ O
energy _ O
markets _ B-key
and _ O
supply _ B-key
chains _ I-key
and _ O
added _ O
to _ O
the _ O
already _ O
evolving _ O
inflationary _ B-key
pressures _ O
and _ O
concerns _ O
over _ O
consumer _ B-key
demand _ I-key
. _ O

Consequently _ O
, _ O
growth _ O
forecasts _ O
have _ O
been _ O
slashed _ O
. _ O

The _ O
International _ B-key
Monetary _ I-key
Fund _ I-key
( _ O
IMF _ B-key
) _ O
now _ O
expects _ O
the _ O
world _ O
economy _ B-key
to _ O
grow _ O
by _ O
3.6% _ O
in _ O
CY22 _ O
, _ O
which _ O
is _ O
0.8 _ O
percentage _ O
points _ O
lower _ O
than _ O
its _ O
pre-war _ O
projections _ O
. _ O

Many _ O
economies _ O
have _ O
experienced _ O
a _ O
sharp _ O
surge _ O
in _ O
inflation _ B-key
, _ O
particularly _ O
in _ O
food _ O
and _ O
fuel _ O
prices _ B-key
, _ O
taking _ O
their _ O
inflation _ B-key
rates _ I-key
to _ O
multi-decade _ O
highs _ O
. _ O

Central _ O
banks _ O
have _ O
been _ O
forced _ O
to _ O
respond _ O
to _ O
surging _ O
prices _ B-key
with _ O
aggressive _ O
rate _ B-key
hikes _ O
. _ O

The _ O
pace _ O
of _ O
monetary _ B-key
tightening _ O
is _ O
turning _ O
out _ O
to _ O
be _ O
quite _ O
swift _ O
as _ O
central _ O
bankers _ O
attempt _ O
to _ O
catch _ O
up _ O
with _ O
the _ O
rising _ O
inflation _ B-key
from _ O
their _ O
ultra-accommodative _ O
stance _ O
during _ O
the _ O
pandemic _ B-key
. _ O

As _ O
the _ O
stance _ O
of _ O
monetary _ B-key
policy _ I-key
shifts _ O
, _ O
there _ O
is _ O
greater _ O
turbulence _ O
in _ O
currency _ B-key
markets _ I-key
. _ O

The _ O
dollar _ O
has _ O
strengthened _ O
, _ O
while _ O
emerging _ O
economies _ O
have _ O
witnessed _ O
downward _ O
pressure _ O
on _ O
their _ O
currencies _ B-key
. _ O

At _ O
the _ O
same _ O
time _ O
, _ O
energy _ O
and _ O
commodity _ O
markets _ B-key
have _ O
witnessed _ O
heightened _ O
volatility _ O
. _ O

Global _ O
supply _ B-key
chain _ I-key
disruptions _ O
due _ O
to _ O
pandemic-induced _ B-key
lockdowns _ O
have _ O
been _ O
replaced _ O
by _ O
new _ O
disruptions _ O
caused _ O
by _ O
the _ O
war _ O
in _ O
Ukraine _ O
and _ O
the _ O
economic _ B-key
sanctions _ O
. _ O

While _ O
the _ O
global _ B-key
economic _ I-key
backdrop _ O
remains _ O
challenging _ O
, _ O
there _ O
are _ O
reasons _ O
to _ O
remain _ O
optimistic _ O
. _ O

First _ O
, _ O
despite _ O
the _ O
slowdown _ O
, _ O
IMF _ B-key
’ _ I-key
s _ I-key
projection _ O
of _ O
world _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
CY22 _ O
is _ O
still _ O
tracking _ O
the _ O
pre-pandemic _ B-key
average _ O
. _ O

Second _ O
, _ O
fiscal _ O
support _ O
in _ O
developed _ O
economies _ O
remains _ O
above _ O
the _ O
pre-pandemic _ B-key
trend _ B-key
, _ O
although _ O
diluted _ O
, _ O
versus _ O
past _ O
years _ O
. _ O

Third _ O
, _ O
mega-trends _ B-key
around _ O
sustainability _ O
, _ O
green _ O
investments _ B-key
, _ O
digitisation _ B-key
, _ O
and _ O
disintermediation _ B-key
remain _ O
well-entrenched _ O
and _ O
will _ O
support _ O
growth _ O
and _ O
productivity _ B-key
enhancement _ O
in _ O
the _ O
medium-term _ O
. _ O

Thus _ O
, _ O
while _ O
businesses _ O
will _ O
need _ O
to _ O
remain _ O
on _ O
guard _ O
regarding _ O
financial _ B-key
market _ I-key
volatility _ O
and _ O
cost _ O
pressures _ O
this _ O
year _ O
, _ O
one _ O
could _ O
expect _ O
the _ O
medium-term _ O
growth _ O
recovery _ O
to _ O
remain _ O
on _ O
track _ O
. _ O

We _ O
