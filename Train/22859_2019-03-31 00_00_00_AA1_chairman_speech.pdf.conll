the _ O

, _ O
it _ O
used _ O
to _ O

Ashwin _ O
Choksi _ O
, _ O
addressing _ O
all _ O

He _ O
was _ O
truly _ O
an _ O
amazing _ O
human _ O
being _ O
inspiring _ O
all _ O
of _ O
us _ O
to _ O
aim _ O
and _ O
achieve _ O
big _ O

at _ O

time _ O
retain _ O

Always _ O

with _ O
the _ O
younger _ O
generation _ O
of _ O
employees _ O
, _ O
understanding _ O
their _ O
views _ O

imperatives _ O
relevant _ O
with _ O
times _ O
. _ O

I _ O

reassuring _ O
smile _ O
in _ O
my _ O
endeavour _ O

On _ O
March _ O
31st _ O
, _ O
2019 _ O
, _ O
three _ O
stalwarts _ O
of _ O
our _ O
Board _ O
who _ O
have _ O
served _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
for _ O
many _ O
years _ O
, _ O
helping _ O
build _ O
what _ O
it _ O
is _ O
today _ O
, _ O
retired _ O
. _ O

I _ O

Mr _ O

  _ O

Mahendra _ O

Asian _ O
Paints _ O
Ltd _ O

all _ O
its _ O

Looking _ O
back _ O
at _ O
FY2018 _ O
- _ O
19 _ O
, _ O
it _ O
turned _ O
out _ O
to _ O
be _ O
another _ O
roller-coaster _ O
period _ O
with _ O
its _ O
share _ O
of _ O
uncertainty _ O
and _ O
volatility _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
positive _ O
side _ O
, _ O
we _ O
saw _ O
some _ O
improvement _ O
in _ O
the _ O
demand _ O
conditions _ O
in _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
market _ O
as _ O
compared _ O
to _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
with _ O
trade _ B-key
and _ I-key
supply _ I-key
channels _ I-key
recovering _ O
from _ O
the _ O
past _ O
disruptions _ O
caused _ O
by _ O
demonetisation _ O
and _ O
the _ O
implementation _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Goods _ B-key
and _ I-key
Services _ I-key
Tax _ I-key
( _ I-key
GST _ I-key
) _ I-key
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
customer _ O
confidence _ O
was _ O
uncertain _ O
and _ O
this _ O
has _ O
reflected _ O
in _ O
a _ O
marked _ O
slowdown _ O
We _ O
navigate _ O
through _ O
the _ O
ever-changing _ O
business _ O
landscape _ O
to _ O
create _ O
growth _ O
avenues _ O
for _ O
the _ O
future _ O

Asian _ O

Annual _ B-key
Report _ I-key
2018 _ O
- _ O
19 _ O
14 _ O
witnessed _ O
in _ O
some _ O
of _ O
the _ O
large _ O
sectors _ O
of _ O
the _ O
economy _ B-key
, _ O
particularly _ O
in _ O
the _ O
last _ O
quarter _ O
of _ O
the _ O
financial _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Persistently _ O
tight _ O
credit _ O
conditions _ O
accentuated _ O
by _ O
the _ O
challenges _ O
in _ O
the _ O
NBFC _ B-key
( _ I-key
Non-Banking _ I-key
Financial _ I-key
Company _ I-key
) _ I-key
sector _ I-key
, _ O
rising _ O
unemployment _ O
and _ O
low _ O
rural _ O
and _ O
urban _ O
income _ O
growth _ O
were _ O
key _ O
contributors _ O
to _ O
the _ O
dampened _ O
sentiment _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
was _ O
also _ O
marked _ O
by _ O
high _ B-key
inflation _ I-key
on _ O
the _ O
raw _ O
material _ O
front _ O
leading _ O
to _ O
a _ O
tightening _ O
of _ O
the _ O
operating _ O
margins _ O
. _ O

And _ O
though _ O
we _ O
were _ O
able _ O
to _ O
recover _ O
a _ O
part _ O
of _ O
the _ O
margin _ O
pressure _ O
through _ O
price _ O
increases _ O
, _ O
the _ O
uncertain _ O
demand _ B-key
conditions _ I-key
meant _ O
a _ O
consistent _ O
drive _ O
in _ O
the _ O
business _ O
to _ O
optimise _ O
its _ O
cost _ O
structure _ O
to _ O
alleviate _ O
the _ O
margin _ O
pressure _ O
. _ O

The _ O
international _ O
markets _ O
faced _ O
their _ O
own _ O
set _ O
of _ O
challenges _ O
with _ O
some _ O
markets _ O
affected _ O
by _ O
foreign _ O
exchange _ O
tightness _ O
while _ O
a _ O
few _ O
impacted _ O
by _ O
very _ O
high _ B-key
inflation _ I-key
levels _ O
and _ O
low _ O
GDP _ B-key
growths _ O
. _ O

At _ O
the _ O
overall _ O
level _ O
, _ O
I _ O
am _ O
very _ O
happy _ O
with _ O
the _ O
performance _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
able _ O
to _ O
deliver _ O
not _ O
withstanding _ O
difficult _ O
business _ O
conditions _ O
. _ O

Focussed _ O
efforts _ O
in _ O
expanding _ O
the _ O
market _ O
by _ O
looking _ O
at _ O
upgradation _ O
from _ O
bottom _ O
of _ O
the _ O
pyramid _ O
resulted _ O
in _ O
volume _ O

of _ O
the _ O
India _ O
business _ O
to _ O
be _ O
the _ O
highest _ O
in _ O
the _ O

few _ O
years _ O
