Before _ O

on _ O
our _ O
performance _ O
for _ O
the _ O

, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
pertinent _ O
to _ O
share _ O
a _ O
few _ O
words _ O
on _ O
the _ O
India _ O
growth _ O
story _ O
, _ O
which _ O
we _ O
are _ O
extremely _ O
bullish _ O
about _ O
. _ O

Notwithstanding _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
India _ O
aspires _ O
to _ O
become _ O
a _ O
5 _ O
trillion-dollar _ O
economy _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
next _ O
few _ O
years _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
this _ O
growth _ O
needs _ O
to _ O
be _ O
more _ O
inclusive _ O
and _ O
diverse _ O
to _ O
raise _ O
the _ O
quality _ O
of _ O
lives _ O
of _ O
millions _ O
of _ O

, _ O
conserve _ O

deploy _ O

prudently _ O
and _ O
drive _ O
the _ O

As _ O

of _ O

s _ O
leading _ O
core _ O
sector _ O
players _ O
, _ O
with _ O

a _ O

this _ O

COVID _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
hit _ O
the _ O
world _ O
hard _ O
to _ O
say _ O
the _ O
least _ O
, _ O
and _ O
unprecedented _ O
lockdowns _ O
disrupted _ O
economies _ B-key
, _ O
businesses _ O
and _ O
society _ O
in _ O
a _ O
manner _ O
that _ O
we _ O
have _ O
never _ O
seen _ O
in _ O
our _ O
lives _ O
. _ O

India _ O
was _ O
no _ O
exception _ O
, _ O
but _ O
our _ O
country _ O
has _ O
managed _ O
to _ O
flatten _ O
the _ O
COVID _ B-key
- _ I-key
19 _ I-key
curve _ O
remarkably _ O
better _ O
than _ O
many _ O
other _ O
economies _ B-key
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
made _ O
possible _ O
by _ O
the _ O
government _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
timely _ O
and _ O
consistent _ O
interventions _ O
to _ O
enforce _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
one _ O
of _ O
our _ O
major _ O
concerns _ O
was _ O
to _ O
ensure _ O
the _ O
well-being _ O
of _ O
our _ O
community _ O
and _ O
lend _ O
a _ O
helping _ O

that _ O
touched _ O
the _ O
lives _ O
of _ O
more _ O
than _ O
34 _ O

The _ O
initiatives _ O
included _ O
the _ O

the _ O

Resolute _ O
steps _ O
forward _ O
During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
adopted _ O
a _ O
razor-sharp _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
‘ _ O
health _ O
, _ O
cost _ B-key
and _ O
cash _ O
’ _ O
and _ O
resolutely _ O
steered _ O
the _ O
business _ O
forward _ O
, _ O
notwithstanding _ O
the _ O
adversity _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
concerted _ O
efforts _ O
also _ O
helped _ O
restart _ O
operations _ O
and _ O
dispatches _ O
faster _ O
than _ O
our _ O
industry _ O
peers _ O
. _ O

The _ O
result _ O
was _ O
that _ O
despite _ O
a _ O
2% _ O
decline _ O
in _ O
the _ O
topline _ O
, _ O
we _ O
could _ O
grow _ O
our _ O

23% _ O
and _ O

Industry _ O
scenario _ O
Acute _ O
shortage _ O
of _ O

and _ O

measures _ O
resulted _ O
in _ O
the _ O
suspension _ O
of _ O
construction _ O
activities _ O
across _ O
the _ O
country _ O
, _ O
which _ O
adversely _ O
impacted _ O
the _ O

. _ O

After _ O
an _ O
uninspiring _ O
first _ O
half _ O
, _ O
the _ O
second _ O
half _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O
reported _ O
stronger _ O
recovery _ O
and _ O
8% _ O

driven _ O
by _ O
a _ O
gradual _ O
pick-up _ O

the _ O

thrust _ O

The _ O

reported _ O
a _ O

of _ O
11% _ O
during _ O
the _ O
whole _ O
year _ O
, _ O
while _ O
Ambuja _ O

declined _ O
by _ O
6% _ O

This _ O
vindicated _ O
the _ O
strength _ O
of _ O
our _ O
fundamentals _ O
. _ O

We _ O
expect _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
to _ O
improve _ O
further _ O
during _ O
2021 _ O
. _ O

Given _ O
the _ O
government _ O

s _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
affordable _ O

, _ O
we _ O
believe _ O
that _ O

a _ O

growth _ O
potential _ O
in _ O
the _ O
coming _ O

in _ O

The _ O

accounts _ O
for _ O
over _ O
65% _ O
of _ O
the _ O

In _ O

Ambuja _ O
