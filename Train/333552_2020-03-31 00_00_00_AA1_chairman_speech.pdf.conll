are _ O
taking _ O
all _ O
the _ O
necessary _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
years _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
humbled _ O
by _ O
the _ O
trust _ O
and _ O
loyalty _ O
that _ O
our _ O

during _ O
challenging _ O
times _ O
such _ O
as _ O
the _ O
nation-wide _ O
lockdown _ O
. _ O

To _ O
this _ O
end _ O
, _ O
where _ O
permitted _ O
locally _ O
, _ O
we _ O
continued _ O
our _ O
operations _ O
using _ O
multiple _ O
delivery _ O
channels _ O
, _ O
and _ O
made _ O
available _ O
daily _ O
essential _ O
products _ O
to _ O
our _ O
customers _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
larger _ O
commitments _ O
As _ O
we _ O
grow _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
also _ O
increasingly _ O
mindful _ O
of _ O
our _ O
responsibility _ O
towards _ O
the _ O
society _ O
and _ O
the _ O
environment _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O

the _ O
disadvantaged _ O
with _ O
our _ O
corporate _ O
social _ O
responsibility _ O
initiatives _ O
, _ O
and _ O
the _ O
results _ O
from _ O
the _ O
same _ O
are _ O
quite _ O
heartwarming _ O
. _ O

This _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
helped _ O
more _ O
than _ O
100,000 _ O
young _ O
school _ O
students _ O
in _ O
their _ O
endeavour _ O
to _ O
better _ O
educate _ O
themselves _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
governance _ O
front _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
an _ O
experienced _ O
management _ O
, _ O
supported _ O
and _ O
supervised _ O
by _ O
a _ O
Board _ O
that _ O
I _ O
’ _ O
m _ O
part _ O
of _ O
, _ O
and _ O
a _ O
mentor _ O
, _ O
whose _ O
vision _ O
has _ O
helped _ O
us _ O
scale _ O
new _ O
heights _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
efforts _ O
to _ O
deliver _ O
and _ O
grow _ O
have _ O
been _ O
a _ O
function _ O
of _ O
a _ O
highly _ O
motivated _ O
workforce _ O
that _ O
remains _ O
the _ O
bedrock _ O
of _ O
our _ O
success _ O
. _ O

Every _ O
day _ O
, _ O
their _ O
hard _ O
work _ O
and _ O
service _ O
mindset _ O
drive _ O
us _ O
forward _ O
, _ O
and _ O
I _ O
take _ O
this _ O
opportunity _ O
to _ O
heartily _ O
thank _ O
them _ O
. _ O

I _ O
would _ O
also _ O
like _ O
to _ O
mention _ O
the _ O
role _ O
of _ O
our _ O
trusted _ O
suppliers _ O
and _ O
manufacturers _ O
, _ O
who _ O
play _ O
a _ O
vital _ O
role _ O
in _ O
our _ O
success _ O
, _ O
and _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
thank _ O
them _ O
for _ O
their _ O
continued _ O
support _ O
. _ O

Looking _ O
forward _ O
This _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
completed _ O
a _ O
successful _ O
equity _ O
fund _ O
raise _ O
, _ O
and _ O
our _ O
promoter _ O
also _ O
undertook _ O
a _ O
stock _ O
sell-down _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Company _ O
has _ O
thus _ O
met _ O
its _ O
minimum _ O
public _ O
shareholding _ O
norm _ O
as _ O
prescribed _ O
by _ O
the _ O
regulator _ O
. _ O

I _ O
would _ O
like _ O
to _ O
extend _ O
a _ O
warm _ O
welcome _ O
to _ O
all _ O
our _ O
new _ O
shareholders _ O
and _ O
look _ O
forward _ O
to _ O
their _ O
support _ O
in _ O
the _ O
coming _ O
years _ O
. _ O

As _ O
I _ O
look _ O
ahead _ O
, _ O
there _ O
is _ O
indeed _ O
a _ O
short-term _ O
uncertainty _ O
as _ O
the _ O
world _ O
adopts _ O
a _ O
new _ O
normal _ O
. _ O

That _ O
said _ O
, _ O
it _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
also _ O
heartening _ O
to _ O
see _ O
that _ O
world _ O
over _ O
, _ O
there _ O
are _ O
concerted _ O
efforts _ O
to _ O
tide _ O
over _ O
this _ O
phase _ O
quickly _ O
and _ O
responsibly _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
of _ O
the _ O
strong _ O
belief _ O
that _ O
together _ O
with _ O
everyone _ O
, _ O
we _ O
hope _ O
to _ O
pass _ O
this _ O
phase _ O
and _ O
set _ O
the _ O
ground _ O
for _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
