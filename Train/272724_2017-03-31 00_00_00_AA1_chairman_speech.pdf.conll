2017 _ O
, _ O
we _ O
introduced _ O
the _ O

Brand _ O

of _ O
Wipro _ O
and _ O
rearticulated _ O
our _ O
Values _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
also _ O
marks _ O
the _ O
70th _ O
anniversary _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O

as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
the _ O
Emerging _ O

, _ O

. _ O

Wipro _ O
faces _ O
this _ O
changing _ O
environment _ O
with _ O
optimism _ O
. _ O

In _ O
my _ O
letter _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
I _ O
touched _ O
upon _ O
the _ O
pervasive _ O
change _ O
that _ O
businesses _ O
were _ O
experiencing _ O
. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
saw _ O
further _ O
evidence _ O
of _ O
a _ O
drastic _ O
change _ O
in _ O
expectations _ O
and _ O
experiences _ O
of _ O
consumers _ O
and _ O
business _ O
models _ O
. _ O

Digital _ O
is _ O
the _ O
central _ O
element _ O
driving _ O
this _ O
change _ O
. _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
IT _ O
Services _ O
companies _ O
are _ O
key _ O
to _ O
delivering _ O
Digital _ O
to _ O
enterprises _ B-key
. _ O

At _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
we _ O
strongly _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
our _ O
success _ O
will _ O
depend _ O
on _ O
our _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
redefine _ O
and _ O
align _ O
ourselves _ O
with _ O
the _ O
new _ O
global _ O
paradigms _ O
and _ O
the _ O
disruptive _ O
developments _ O
in _ O
our _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
context _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
made _ O
significant _ O
investments _ O
, _ O
organic _ O
and _ O
inorganic _ O
, _ O
and _ O
developed _ O
capabilities _ O
to _ O
serve _ O
our _ O
clients _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
clients _ O
profoundly _ O
value _ O
our _ O
capacity _ O
to _ O
meld _ O
our _ O
deep _ O
technology _ O
and _ O
domain _ O
expertise _ O
for _ O
solutions _ O
across _ O
a _ O
very _ O
wide _ O
range _ O
of _ O
their _ O
business _ O
needs _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
complemented _ O
by _ O
our _ O
capability _ O
to _ O
draw _ O
and _ O
apply _ O
insights _ O
from _ O
across _ O
industries _ O
, _ O
to _ O
deliver _ O
with _ O
consistent _ O
excellence _ O
and _ O
integrated _ O
end-to-end _ O
capabilities _ O
and _ O
services _ O
. _ O

Brand _ O
Identity _ O
and _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
Our _ O
earlier _ O
brand _ O
identity _ O
has _ O
been _ O
an _ O
enormous _ O
source _ O
of _ O
strength _ O
for _ O
us _ O
since _ O
1998 _ O
, _ O
and _ O
so _ O
has _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
articulation _ O
of _ O
our _ O
values _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
from _ O
2006 _ O
. _ O

So _ O
, _ O
the _ O
introduction _ O
of _ O
the _ O
new _ O
identity _ O
and _ O
the _ O
rearticulated _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
is _ O
a _ O
rare _ O
and _ O
important _ O
occasion _ O
. _ O

The _ O
creation _ O
of _ O
intellectual _ O
capital _ O
results _ O
from _ O
investments _ B-key
in _ O
human _ O
capital _ O
. _ O

Last _ O
year _ O
we _ O
trained _ O
over _ O
39,000 _ O
employees _ O
in _ O
Digital _ B-key
technologies _ I-key
. _ O

Our _ O
investments _ O
in _ O
emerging _ O
technology _ O
spaces _ O
of _ O
Artificial _ B-key
Intelligence _ I-key
, _ O
Data _ B-key
Analytics _ I-key
and _ O
Digital _ O
resulted _ O
in _ O
603 _ O

. _ O

Our _ O
work _ O
in _ O
school _ O
education _ O
, _ O
community _ O
care _ O
and _ O
ecology _ O
enhances _ O
social _ O
and _ O
natural _ O
capital _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Wipro _ O
Science _ O
Education _ O
Fellowship _ O
for _ O
teachers _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
has _ O
now _ O
expanded _ O
to _ O
the _ O
city _ O
of _ O
Dallas _ O
, _ O
while _ O
we _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
work _ O
closely _ O
with _ O
teachers _ O
in _ O
Boston _ O
, _ O
Chicago _ O
, _ O
New _ O
Jersey _ O
and _ O
New _ O
York _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
making _ O
very _ O
satisfactory _ O
progress _ O
on _ O
all _ O
our _ O
Sustainability _ O
Goals _ O
. _ O

The _ O
fact _ O
that _ O
38% _ O
of _ O
all _ O
our _ O
water _ O
requirements _ O
is _ O
met _ O
through _ O
recycling _ O
helps _ O
preserve _ O
a _ O
precious _ O
natural _ O
resource _ O
. _ O

In _ O
combination _ O
with _ O
improvements _ O
in _ O
water _ O
efficiency _ O
, _ O
we _ O
saved _ O
nearly _ O
500 _ O
million _ O
liters _ O
of _ O
water _ O
last _ O
year _ O
. _ O

These _ O
water _ O
efficiency _ O
initiatives _ O
reduce _ O
pressure _ O
on _ O
freshwater _ O
resources _ O
and _ O
pares _ O
energy _ O
consumption _ O
. _ O

In _ O
2016 _ O
- _ O

, _ O
our _ O
absolute _ O
greenhouse _ O
gas _ O
emissions _ O
reduced _ O
by _ O
nearly _ O
30,000 _ O
tons _ O
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
driven _ O
by _ O
our _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
footprint _ O
which _ O
stands _ O
at _ O
25% _ O
of _ O
our _ O
overall _ O
electricity _ O
consumption _ O
and _ O
investments _ O
in _ O
energy _ B-key
efficiency _ I-key
. _ O

We _ O
will _ O
continue _ O
to _ O
vigorously _ O
drive _ O
both _ O
these _ O
dimensions _ O
in _ O
line _ O
with _ O
our _ O
defined _ O
targets _ O
for _ O
2020 _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
new _ O
brand _ O
identity _ O
resonates _ O
deeply _ O
with _ O
this _ O
fundamental _ O
approach _ O
of _ O
value _ O
creation _ O
on _ O
multiple _ O
dimensions _ O
, _ O
reflected _ O
in _ O
the _ O
energetic _ O
and _ O
organic _ O
integration _ O
of _ O
diversity _ O
in _ O
the _ O
identity _ O
. _ O

And _ O
at _ O
our _ O
core _ O
, _ O
is _ O
the _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
which _ O
directly _ O
guides _ O
us _ O
to _ O
be _ O
responsible _ O
as _ O
a _ O
global _ O
citizen _ O
of _ O
this _ O
planet _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
me _ O
end _ O
by _ O
thanking _ O
you _ O
and _ O
all _ O
our _ O
stakeholders _ O
, _ O
for _ O
the _ O
trust _ O
and _ O
faith _ O
that _ O
you _ O
repose _ O
in _ O

2017 _ O
Wipro _ O
has _ O
been _ O
built _ O
by _ O
an _ O
unflinching _ O
commitment _ O
to _ O
values _ O
. _ O

And _ O
our _ O
Brand _ O
identity _ O
has _ O
been _ O
a _ O
clear _ O
visual _ O
representation _ O
of _ O
what _ O
we _ O
do _ O
for _ O
our _ O
clients _ O
, _ O
what _ O
we _ O
mean _ O
to _ O
them _ O
, _ O
and _ O
so _ O
in _ O
a _ O
deep _ O
sense _ O
why _ O
we _ O
exist _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
new _ O
brand _ O
identity _ O
is _ O
energizing _ O
and _ O
exciting _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
a _ O
very _ O
apt _ O
visual _ O
expression _ O
of _ O
why _ O
we _ O
exist _ O
: _ O
to _ O
amplify _ O
our _ O
client _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
success _ O
. _ O

The _ O
new _ O
identity _ O
reflects _ O
our _ O
transformation _ O
in _ O
the _ O
enormously _ O
diverse _ O
, _ O
yet _ O
deeply _ O
connected _ O
world _ O
. _ O

It _ O
captures _ O
our _ O
expanding _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
generate _ O
insights _ O
from _ O
interconnected _ O
perspectives _ O
. _ O

And _ O
to _ O
bring _ O
these _ O
insights _ O
to _ O
bear _ O
directly _ O
on _ O
innovations _ O
which _ O
drive _ O
our _ O
clients _ O
’ _ O
business _ O
success _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
energizes _ O
us _ O
to _ O
make _ O
this _ O
happen _ O
. _ O

The _ O
rearticulated _ O
Spirit _ O
is _ O
deeply _ O
resonant _ O
with _ O
the _ O
new _ O
identity _ O
. _ O

It _ O
reflects _ O
our _ O
transformation _ O
, _ O
yet _ O
remains _ O
firmly _ O
rooted _ O
in _ O
who _ O
we _ O
are _ O
and _ O
have _ O
been _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
as _ O
it _ O
must _ O
be _ O
, _ O
because _ O
the _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
is _ O
the _ O
core _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
our _ O
character _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
the _ O
unchanging _ O
essence _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
while _ O
embracing _ O
what _ O
we _ O
must _ O
aspire _ O
to _ O
be _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
for _ O
this _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
is _ O
our _ O
beacon _ O
. _ O

With _ O
our _ O
vibrant _ O
new _ O
brand _ O
identity _ O
and _ O
the _ O
rearticulated _ O
Spirit _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
, _ O
I _ O
see _ O
enormous _ O
source _ O
of _ O
energy _ O
to _ O
power _ O
success _ O
: _ O
the _ O
success _ O
of _ O
our _ O
clients _ O
, _ O
the _ O
success _ O
of _ O
our _ O
employees _ O
, _ O
the _ O
success _ O
of _ O
our _ O
stakeholders _ O
and _ O
therefore _ O
the _ O
success _ O
of _ O
Wipro _ O
. _ O

Stakeholder _ O
Value _ O
We _ O
continually _ O
strive _ O
to _ O
enhance _ O
value _ O
for _ O
investors _ O
. _ O

The _ O
trust _ O
that _ O
our _ O
clients _ O
place _ O
in _ O
us _ O
is _ O
at _ O
the _ O
heart _ O
of _ O
this _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
a _ O
philosophy _ O
of _ O
providing _ O
regular _ O
and _ O
stable _ O
payout _ O
to _ O
investors _ O
and _ O
prudently _ O
evaluate _ O
capital _ O
allocation _ O
decisions _ O
, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
interest _ O
of _ O
building _ O
long _ O
term _ O
stakeholder _ O
value _ O
. _ O

Consistent _ O
with _ O
this _ O
approach _ O
, _ O
we _ O
announced _ O
a _ O
bonus _ O
issue _ O
. _ O

Shortly _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Board _ O
will _ O
also _ O
consider _ O
a _ O
proposal _ O
to _ O
buyback _ O
equity _ O
shares _ O
of _ O
the _ O
company _ O
. _ O

The _ O
value _ O
that _ O
a _ O
company _ O
creates _ O
for _ O
its _ O
stakeholders _ O
is _ O
not _ O
just _ O
financial _ O
but _ O
also _ O
social _ O
, _ O
environmental _ O
, _ O
intellectual _ O
and _ O
human _ O
. _ O

For _ O
example _ O
, _ O
companies _ O
create _ O
social _ O
value _ O
by _ O
investing _ O
in _ O
employee _ O
skilling _ O
and _ O
development _ O
, _ O
through _ O
its _ O
products _ O
and _ O
services _ O
and _ O
through _ O
the _ O
relationships _ O
it _ O
builds _ O
with _ O
its _ O
customers _ O
and _ O
suppliers _ O
. _ O

Social _ O
value _ O
is _ O
also _ O
created _ O
when _ O
companies _ O
engage _ O
with _ O
its _ O
communities _ O
and _ O
work _ O
on _ O
some _ O
of _ O
society _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
most _ O
pressing _ O
issues _ O
. _ O

It _ O
creates _ O
environmental _ O
value _ O
by _ O
being _ O
more _ O
ecologically _ O
sustainable _ O
. _ O

Continuing _ O
from _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
a _ O
predominant _ O
theme _ O
of _ O
our _ O
report _ O
this _ O
year _ O
is _ O
on _ O
how _ O
we _ O
create _ O
value _ O
on _ O
the _ O
five _ O
dimensions _ O
of _ O
financial _ O
, _ O
human _ O
, _ O
social _ O
, _ O
natural _ O
and _ O
intellectual _ O
capital _ O
. _ O
