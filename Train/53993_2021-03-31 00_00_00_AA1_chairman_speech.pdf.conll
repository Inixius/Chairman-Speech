most _ O
challenging _ O
period _ O
of _ O
our _ O
lives _ O
and _ O
I _ O
extend _ O
my _ O
heartfelt _ O
condolences _ O
to _ O
all _ O
who _ O
have _ O
suffered _ O
during _ O
this _ O
calamity _ O
. _ O

We _ O
, _ O
at _ O
DLF _ O
, _ O
in _ O
our _ O
own _ O
small _ O
way _ O
undertook _ O
a _ O
large _ O
number _ O
of _ O
initiatives _ O
to _ O
assist _ O
the _ O
underprivileged _ O
, _ O
including _ O
providing _ O
hundreds _ O
of _ O
thousands _ O
of _ O
meals _ O

support _ O
kits _ O
for _ O
them _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
best _ O
