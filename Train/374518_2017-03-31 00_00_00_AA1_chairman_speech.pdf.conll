s _ O
Letter _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholder _ O
, _ O
I _ O
thought _ O
of _ O
starting _ O
with _ O
encouraging _ O
news _ O
about _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
2016 _ O
- _ O
17 _ O
( _ O
FY2017 _ O
) _ O
. _ O

But _ O
as _ O
I _ O
started _ O
looking _ O
at _ O
the _ O
latest _ O
evidence _ O
, _ O
it _ O
didn _ O
’ _ O
t _ O
seem _ O
as _ O
encouraging _ O
as _ O
I _ O
believed _ O
it _ O
might _ O
be _ O
. _ O

In _ O
its _ O
latest _ O
advance _ O
estimate _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Central _ O
Statistical _ O
Organisation _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
has _ O
pegged _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
real _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
for _ O
FY2017 _ O
at _ O
7.1% _ O
. _ O

No _ O
doubt _ O
it _ O
is _ O
better _ O
than _ O
all _ O
developed _ O
countries _ O
and _ O
most _ O
emerging _ O
markets _ O
including _ O
China _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
not _ O
as _ O
good _ O
as _ O
the _ O
7.9% _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
achieved _ O
in _ O
FY2016 _ O
. _ O

So _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
grown _ O
; _ O
but _ O
not _ O
as _ O
much _ O
as _ O
last _ O
year _ O
. _ O

And _ O
we _ O
possibly _ O
have _ O
a _ O
longer _ O
way _ O
to _ O
go _ O
to _ O
attain _ O
a _ O
steady _ O
state _ O
annual _ O
growth _ O
rate _ O
between _ O
7.5% _ O
and _ O
8% _ O
, _ O
which _ O
is _ O
what _ O
we _ O
need _ O
to _ O
create _ O
a _ O
launchpad _ O
for _ O
greater _ O
employment _ O
, _ O
a _ O
more _ O
significant _ O
global _ O
economic _ O
presence _ O
and _ O
accelerated _ O
poverty _ O
reduction _ O
. _ O

In _ O
my _ O
view _ O
three _ O
factors _ O
have _ O
played _ O
a _ O
role _ O
in _ O
dampening _ O
growth _ O
this _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
first _ O
is _ O
the _ O
lack _ O
of _ O
significant _ O
investments _ O
over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
four _ O
to _ O
five _ O
years _ O
. _ O

Of _ O
late _ O
, _ O
there _ O
has _ O
been _ O
a _ O
serious _ O
effort _ O
at _ O
government _ O
investments _ O
in _ O
some _ O
key _ O
infrastructure _ O
areas _ O
. _ O

But _ O
that _ O
takes _ O
time _ O
to _ O
translate _ O
into _ O
additional _ O
income _ O
and _ O
employment _ O
. _ O

And _ O
truth _ O
be _ O
told _ O
, _ O
there _ O
is _ O
hardly _ O
any _ O
private _ O
sector _ O
investment _ O
worth _ O
the _ O
name _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
is _ O
also _ O
related _ O
to _ O
private _ O
sector _ O
investments _ O
but _ O
linked _ O
to _ O
the _ O
state _ O
of _ O
our _ O
banks _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
many _ O
of _ O
those _ O
under _ O
government _ O
ownership _ O
. _ O

The _ O
data _ O
for _ O
the _ O
quarter _ O
ended _ O
31 _ O
December _ O
2016 _ O
shows _ O
that _ O
for _ O
the _ O
27 _ O
public _ O
sector _ O
banks _ O
which _ O
account _ O
for _ O
the _ O
vast _ O
majority _ O
of _ O
the _ O
nation _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
loans _ O
and _ O
advances _ O
, _ O
bad _ O
loans _ O
, _ O
called _ O
gross _ O
non-performing _ O
assets _ O
( _ O
NPAs _ O
) _ O
, _ O
were _ O
estimated _ O
at _ O
H _ O
647,759 _ O
crore _ O
, _ O
or _ O
88% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
total _ O
recorded _ O
NPAs _ O
across _ O
all _ O
banks _ O
. _ O

This _ O
represents _ O
a _ O
140% _ O
increase _ O
over _ O
what _ O
it _ O
was _ O
two _ O
years _ O
earlier _ O
, _ O
and _ O
constitutes _ O
12% _ O
of _ O
total _ O
loans _ O
and _ O
advances _ O
. _ O

With _ O
these _ O
banks _ O
being _ O
badly _ O
stressed _ O
, _ O
there _ O
seems _ O
to _ O
be _ O
no _ O
appetite _ O
for _ O
advancing _ O
term _ O
loans _ O
without _ O
which _ O
it _ O
is _ O
virtually _ O
impossible _ O
to _ O
envisage _ O
the _ O
kind _ O
of _ O
investment _ O
spends _ O
needed _ O
for _ O
getting _ O
us _ O
securely _ O
on _ O
to _ O
a _ O
higher _ O
growth _ O
path _ O
. _ O

The _ O
third _ O
is _ O
a _ O
shorter _ O
term _ O
aberration _ O
related _ O
to _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

I _ O
refer _ O
to _ O
the _ O
temporary _ O
negative _ O
effects _ O
of _ O
demonetising _ O
H _ O
500 _ O
and _ O
H _ O
1,000 _ O
notes _ O
on _ O
8 _ O
November _ O
2016 _ O
. _ O

Although _ O
the _ O
estimates _ O
for _ O
October-December _ O
2016 _ O
show _ O
no _ O
appreciable _ O
dip _ O
in _ O
either _ O
real _ O
GDP _ O
or _ O
GVA _ O
, _ O
there _ O
seems _ O
to _ O
be _ O
enough _ O
evidence _ O
on _ O
the _ O
ground _ O
that _ O
removing _ O
over _ O
four-fifth _ O
of _ O
the _ O
value _ O
of _ O
currency _ O
in _ O
circulation _ O
almost _ O
overnight _ O
and _ O
substituting _ O
it _ O
with _ O
a _ O
much _ O
slower _ O
injection _ O
of _ O
the _ O
new _ O
H _ O
500 _ O
and _ O
H _ O
2,000 _ O
notes _ O
created _ O
constraints _ O
across _ O
various _ O
sectors _ O
of _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
. _ O

It _ O
remains _ O
to _ O
be _ O
seen _ O
what _ O
the _ O
overall _ O
effect _ O
of _ O
this _ O
will _ O
be _ O
on _ O
growth _ O
for _ O
the _ O
first _ O
half _ O
of _ O
FY2018 _ O
. _ O

If _ O
at _ O
all _ O
, _ O
I _ O
hope _ O
it _ O
will _ O
be _ O
moderate _ O
. _ O

In _ O
such _ O
a _ O
milieu _ O
, _ O
how _ O
has _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
fared _ O
? _ O

I _ O
would _ O
say _ O
this _ O
: _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
could _ O
have _ O
possibly _ O
done _ O
better _ O
, _ O
but _ O
given _ O
the _ O
circumstances _ O
, _ O
it _ O
has _ O
done _ O
reasonably _ O
well _ O
to _ O
be _ O
where _ O
it _ O
is _ O
. _ O

key _ O

Limited _ O
At _ O
a _ O
time _ O
of _ O
sluggish _ O
domestic _ O
growth _ O
and _ O
credit _ O
constraints _ O
coupled _ O
with _ O
political _ O
, _ O
economic _ O
and _ O
currency _ O
problems _ O
in _ O
many _ O
countries _ O
that _ O
are _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
leading _ O
importers _ O
of _ O
motorcycles _ O
and _ O
three-wheelers _ O
, _ O
it _ O
requires _ O
considerable _ O
effort _ O
to _ O
fight _ O
against _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
negative _ O
under-current _ O
and _ O
stay _ O
profitable _ O
. _ O

That _ O
is _ O
what _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
has _ O
done _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
me _ O
give _ O
you _ O
two _ O
examples _ O
. _ O

Consider _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
market _ O
for _ O
motorcycles _ O
. _ O

Last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
despite _ O
an _ O
overall _ O
de-growth _ O
of _ O
0.4% _ O
in _ O
the _ O
number _ O
of _ O
motorcycles _ O
sold _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
grew _ O
its _ O
sales _ O
by _ O
7.2% _ O
. _ O

This _ O
year _ O
, _ O
while _ O
the _ O
industry _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
grew _ O
its _ O
domestic _ O
sales _ O
by _ O
3.7% _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
sales _ O
increased _ O
by _ O
5.4% _ O
in _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
volume _ O
to _ O
over _ O
2 _ O
million _ O
motorcycles _ O
. _ O

I _ O
need _ O
to _ O
emphasise _ O
that _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
motorcycle _ O
sales _ O
grew _ O
faster _ O
than _ O
its _ O
major _ O
competitors _ O
. _ O

Similarly _ O
, _ O
in _ O
a _ O
year _ O
when _ O
domestic _ O
three-wheeler _ O
sales _ O
for _ O
the _ O
industry _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
dropped _ O
by _ O
5% _ O
, _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
ended _ O
FY2017 _ O
by _ O
selling _ O
253,226 _ O
vehicles _ O
, _ O
just _ O
0.7% _ O
below _ O
its _ O
all-time _ O
record _ O
sales _ O
of _ O
FY2016 _ O
. _ O

Consequently _ O
, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
three-wheeler _ O
segment _ O
( _ O
passenger _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
goods _ O
) _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
market _ O
share _ O
increased _ O
from _ O
47.4% _ O
last _ O
year _ O
to _ O
49.5% _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

In _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
three-wheeler _ O
passenger _ O
vehicle _ O
industry _ O
, _ O
BAL _ O
expanded _ O
its _ O
market _ O
share _ O
by _ O
2.2 _ O
percentage _ O
points _ O
, _ O
from _ O
57.5% _ O
last _ O
year _ O
to _ O
59.7% _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

Moreover _ O
, _ O
despite _ O
sluggish _ O
growth _ O
, _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
operating _ O
EBITDA _ O
was _ O
at _ O
21.7% _ O
, _ O
which _ O
continues _ O
to _ O
be _ O
the _ O
highest _ O
in _ O
the _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

To _ O
me _ O
, _ O
the _ O
more _ O
significant _ O
problem _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
has _ O
been _ O
the _ O
external _ O
sector _ O
. _ O

In _ O
my _ O
letter _ O
to _ O
you _ O
last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
I _ O
had _ O
written _ O
that _ O
" _ O
due _ O
to _ O
external _ O
factors _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
poor _ O
economic _ O
conditions _ O
and _ O
severe _ O
foreign _ O
currency _ O
constraints _ O
in _ O
some _ O
of _ O
the _ O
key _ O
importing _ O
countries _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
not _ O
succeeded _ O
in _ O
equal _ O
measure _ O
on _ O
the _ O
export _ O
front _ O
— _ O
both _ O
in _ O
motorcycles _ O
and _ O
three-wheelers _ O
" _ O
. _ O

Unfortunately _ O
, _ O
this _ O
has _ O
been _ O
true _ O
for _ O
FY2017 _ O
as _ O
well _ O
and _ O
, _ O
if _ O
I _ O
may _ O
say _ O
so _ O
, _ O
worse _ O
than _ O
in _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Motorcycle _ O
exports _ O
de-grew _ O
by _ O
16.5% _ O
; _ O
and _ O
three-wheeler _ O
exports _ O
fell _ O
by _ O
31.2% _ O
. _ O

In _ O
terms _ O
of _ O
rupees _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
exports _ O
fell _ O
by _ O
over _ O
19% _ O
to _ O
H _ O
7,880 _ O
crore _ O
. _ O

In _ O
US _ O
dollars _ O
, _ O
it _ O
shrank _ O
by _ O
23% _ O
to _ O
$1.09 _ O
billion _ O
. _ O

Even _ O
so _ O
, _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
is _ O
still _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
largest _ O
exporter _ O
of _ O
both _ O
motorcycles _ O
and _ O
three-wheelers _ O
and _ O
it _ O
enjoys _ O
significant _ O
market _ O
shares _ O
. _ O

I _ O
hope _ O
that _ O
exports _ O
will _ O
pick _ O
up _ O
when _ O
some _ O
of _ O
these _ O
markets _ O
abroad _ O
get _ O
into _ O
better _ O
economic _ O
and _ O
financial _ O
shape _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
no _ O
soothsayer _ O
, _ O
and _ O
cannot _ O
forecast _ O
when _ O
. _ O

Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
is _ O
a _ O
sound _ O
and _ O
profitable _ B-key
company _ O
. _ O

What _ O
we _ O
need _ O
is _ O
a _ O
year _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
uptick _ O
to _ O
take _ O
us _ O
on _ O
to _ O
a _ O
new _ O
growth _ O
trajectory _ O
. _ O

May _ O
that _ O
be _ O
FY2018 _ O
