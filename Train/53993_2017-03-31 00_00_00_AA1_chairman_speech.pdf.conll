Message _ O
from _ O
the _ O
Chairman _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ B-key
, _ O
The _ O
key _ O
to _ O
progress _ O
is _ O
change _ O
. _ O

The _ O
past _ O
year _ O
has _ O
witnessed _ O
significant _ O
structural _ O
changes _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
economy _ B-key
that _ O
have _ O
altered _ O
the _ O
business _ B-key
paradigm _ I-key
in _ O
every _ O
sector _ O
, _ O
including _ O
the _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
and _ O
construction _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

Due _ O
to _ O
several _ O
bold _ O
initiatives _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
, _ O
the _ O
nation _ O
is _ O
on _ O
the _ O
cusp _ O
of _ O
a _ O
new _ O
era _ O
of _ O
economic _ B-key
activity _ O
and _ O
opportunity _ O
in _ O
which _ O
the _ O
key _ O
to _ O
success _ O
will _ O
be _ O
the _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
respond _ O
to _ O
change _ O
and _ O
overcome _ O
the _ O
challenges _ O
that _ O
inevitably _ O
arise _ O
during _ O
the _ O
period _ O
of _ O
transition _ O
. _ O

As _ O
I _ O
have _ O
been _ O
frequently _ O
indicating _ O
to _ O
our _ O
stakeholders _ B-key
and _ O
patrons _ O
, _ O
during _ O
the _ O
past _ O
few _ O
years _ O
DLF _ O
has _ O
been _ O
strategically _ B-key
preparing _ O
for _ O
and _ O
indeed _ O
actively _ O
pressing _ O
for _ O
reformatory _ O
legislation _ O
and _ O
visionary _ O
policies _ O
pertaining _ O
to _ O
housing _ O
, _ O
construction _ O
and _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
development _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
glad _ O
to _ O
share _ O
with _ O
you _ O
that _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
is _ O
now _ O
better _ O
equipped _ O
than _ O
many _ O
of _ O
our _ O
peers _ O
to _ O
navigate _ O
through _ O
the _ O
critical _ O
period _ O
of _ O
adaptation _ O
and _ O
course _ O

, _ O
Chairman _ O
corrections _ O
that _ O
lie _ O
ahead _ O
. _ O

This _ O
has _ O
primarily _ O
been _ O
due _ O
to _ O
the _ O
foresight _ O
of _ O
your _ O
management _ B-key
team _ O
which _ O
has _ O
already _ O
put _ O
into _ O
place _ O
many _ O
of _ O
the _ O
internal _ O
structural _ O
changes _ O
and _ O
core _ O
business _ O
portfolio _ O
roadmaps _ O
that _ O
are _ O
best _ O
suited _ O
for _ O
survival _ O
and _ O
success _ O
in _ O
the _ O
changing _ O
scenario _ O
. _ O

As _ O
you _ O
will _ O
recall _ O
, _ O
I _ O
have _ O
been _ O
persistently _ O
advocating _ O
for _ O
streamlining _ O
laws _ O
to _ O
bring _ O
about _ O
greater _ O
transparency _ O
, _ O
accountability _ O
and _ O
compliance _ O
in _ O
the _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
industry _ O
and _ O
to _ O
eliminate _ O
fly-by-night _ O
operators _ O
who _ O
have _ O
for _ O
decades _ O
been _ O
not _ O
only _ O
tarnishing _ O
the _ O
image _ O
of _ O
genuine _ O
developers _ O
but _ O
also _ O
seriously _ O
disrupting _ O
the _ O
housing _ O
market _ B-key
by _ O
defrauding _ O
home-buyers _ O
and _ O
end-users _ O
. _ O

Your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
aspirations _ O
are _ O
in _ O
step _ O
with _ O
the _ O
new _ O
landmark _ O
legislation _ O
that _ O
has _ O
been _ O
enacted _ O
- _ O
the _ O
Real _ O
Estate _ O
( _ O
Regulation _ O
& _ O
Development _ O
) _ O
Act _ O
( _ O
RERA _ O
) _ O
. _ O

Ideally _ O
, _ O
this _ O
would _ O
boost _ O
consumer _ O
confidence _ O
, _ O
pave _ O
the _ O
way _ O
for _ O
accelerated _ O
demand _ B-key
for _ O
housing _ O
products _ O
and _ O
also _ O
facilitate _ O
the _ O
flow _ O
of _ O
investments _ B-key
into _ O
the _ O
realty _ O
sector _ O
, _ O
from _ O
both _ O
global _ O
and _ O
Indian _ O
investors _ B-key
. _ O

Similarly _ O
, _ O
other _ O
major _ O
reforms _ O
like _ O
GST _ B-key
and _ O
the _ O
law _ O
regarding _ O
Benami _ O
Transactions _ O
would _ O
make _ O
it _ O
incumbent _ O
upon _ O
hitherto _ O
non-compliant _ O
players _ O
to _ O
either _ O
comply _ O
or _ O
perish _ O
. _ O

Moreover _ O
, _ O
although _ O
the _ O
shock _ O
decision _ O
to _ O
demonetize _ B-key
high _ O
value _ O
currency _ B-key
notes _ O
has _ O
evidently _ O
led _ O
to _ O
an _ O
initial _ O
slowdown _ O
in _ O
overall _ O
economic _ B-key
growth _ O
for _ O
a _ O
short-term _ O
, _ O
it _ O
will _ O
hopefully _ O
lead _ O
to _ O
more _ O
transparent _ O
housing _ B-key
sector _ I-key
growth _ O
in _ O
the _ O
long _ O
run _ O
. _ O

While _ O
the _ O
various _ O
reform _ O
measures _ O
that _ O
have _ O
been _ O
introduced _ O
are _ O
salutary _ O
and _ O
indeed _ O
long _ O
overdue _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
must _ O
be _ O
mindful _ O
of _ O
the _ O
necessity _ O
to _ O
ease _ O
the _ O
travails _ O
of _ O
transition _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
in _ O
a _ O
competitive _ O
market _ B-key
economy _ I-key
, _ O
by _ O
acting _ O
as _ O
an _ O
enabler _ O
and _ O
facilitator _ O
even _ O
while _ O
exercising _ O
strict _ O
regulatory _ O
control _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
process _ O
of _ O
adjustment _ O
and _ O
adaptation _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
also _ O
essential _ O
to _ O
be _ O
open _ O
to _ O
refining _ O
some _ O
of _ O
the _ O
provisions _ O
of _ O
the _ O
new _ O
regulations _ O
and _ O
, _ O
in _ O
certain _ O
cases _ O
, _ O
rectifying _ O
some _ O
of _ O
the _ O
procedures _ O
and _ O
stipulations _ O
, _ O
in _ O
response _ O
to _ O
practical _ O
difficulties _ O
and _ O
industry _ O
feedback _ O
. _ O

The _ O
truth _ O
is _ O
that _ O
the _ O
real _ B-key
estate _ I-key
sector _ I-key
has _ O
perennially _ O
been _ O
plagued _ O
by _ O
a _ O
plethora _ O
of _ O
archaic _ O
rules _ O
and _ O
burdensome _ O
bureaucratic _ O
formalities _ O
that _ O
hinder _ O
healthy _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

The _ O
ground _ O
reality _ O
of _ O
different _ O
States _ O
having _ O
complex _ O
and _ O
cumbersome _ O
regulations _ O
further _ O
hampers _ O
execution _ O
of _ O
projects _ O
in _ O
time _ O
and _ O
within _ O
the _ O
envisaged _ O
budget _ B-key
. _ O
5 _ O
In _ O
my _ O
view _ O
, _ O
although _ O
the _ O
new _ O
legislation _ O
has _ O
many _ O
positive _ O
and _ O
necessary _ O
features _ O
that _ O
have _ O
been _ O
welcomed _ O
by _ O
builders _ O
and _ O
buyers _ O
alike _ O
, _ O
RERA _ O
regrettably _ O
does _ O
not _ O
adequately _ O
address _ O
certain _ O
crucial _ O
concerns _ O
faced _ O
by _ O
developers _ O
. _ O

From _ O
the _ O
developers _ O
’ _ O
point _ O
of _ O
view _ O
, _ O
I _ O
would _ O
very _ O
briefly _ O
outline _ O
the _ O
aspects _ O
as _ O
– _ O
absence _ O
of _ O
a _ O
single _ O
window _ O
clearance _ O
mechanism _ O
; _ O
imposition _ O
of _ O
additional _ O
layers _ O
of _ O
approvals _ O
; _ O
and _ O
increased _ O
reliance _ O
on _ O
external _ B-key
capital _ I-key
to _ O
achieve _ O
high _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

For _ O
allottees _ O
, _ O
too _ O
, _ O
there _ O
would _ O
be _ O
some _ O
grey _ O
areas _ O
including _ O
the _ O
likelihood _ O
of _ O
delays _ O
in _ O
delivery _ O
of _ O
apartments _ O
and _ O
consequent _ O
price _ B-key
escalation _ O
. _ O

Legislative _ O
reforms _ O
, _ O
in _ O
my _ O
view _ O
, _ O
should _ O
be _ O
primarily _ O
aimed _ O
at _ O
bringing _ O
about _ O
a _ O
happy _ O
balance _ O
between _ O
supply _ B-key
and _ O
demand _ B-key
of _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
products _ O
. _ O

Along _ O
with _ O
ensuring _ O
transparency _ O
, _ O
the _ O
emphasis _ O
of _ O
any _ O
radical _ O
changes _ O
in _ O
policies _ O
and _ O
procedures _ O
should _ O
be _ O
on _ O
allowing _ O
market _ B-key
forces _ O
to _ O
create _ O
a _ O
mutually _ O
beneficial _ O
environment _ O
for _ O
developers _ O
, _ O
buyers _ O
and _ O
all _ O
stakeholders _ B-key
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
but _ O
natural _ O
that _ O
arriving _ O
at _ O
such _ O
a _ O
harmonious _ O
outcome _ O
will _ O
take _ O
awhile _ O
. _ O

It _ O
needs _ O
to _ O
be _ O
kept _ O
in _ O
mind _ O
that _ O
the _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
development _ O
sector _ O
in _ O
India _ O
has _ O
been _ O
passing _ O
through _ O
a _ O
variety _ O
of _ O
challenges _ O
compounded _ O
by _ O
continuing _ O
sluggish _ O
demand _ B-key
, _ O
lack _ O
of _ O
liquidity _ B-key
, _ O
regulatory _ O
pressure _ O
and _ O
piling _ O
up _ O
of _ O
inventory _ O
which _ O
have _ O
collectively _ O
created _ O
uncertainty _ O
about _ O
future _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
confident _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
, _ O
under _ O
the _ O
dynamic _ O
and _ O
far-sighted _ O
leadership _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Hon _ O
’ _ O
ble _ O
Prime _ O
Minister _ O
, _ O
Shri _ O
Narendra _ O
Modi _ O
, _ O
will _ O
accord _ O
utmost _ O
priority _ O
to _ O
addressing _ O
the _ O
concerns _ O
and _ O
removing _ O
the _ O
shackles _ O
to _ O
enable _ O
rapid _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
development _ O
, _ O
which _ O
I _ O
have _ O
always _ O
strongly _ O
believed _ O
will _ O
emerge _ O
as _ O
the _ O
next _ O
Sunrise _ O
Sector _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Indian _ O
economy _ B-key
. _ O

For _ O
this _ O
to _ O
happen _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
must _ O
act _ O
as _ O
an _ O
Enabler _ O
and _ O
Facilitator _ O
, _ O
not _ O
merely _ O
as _ O
a _ O
Regulator _ O
. _ O

The _ O
housing _ O
and _ O
construction _ O
industry _ O
, _ O
which _ O
supports _ O
over _ O
250 _ O
ancillary _ O
industries _ O
, _ O
is _ O
the _ O
second _ O
- _ O
largest _ O
provider _ O
of _ O
jobs _ O
in _ O
the _ O
country _ O
after _ O
agriculture _ O
and _ O
is _ O
recognized _ O
as _ O
a _ O
powerful _ O
engine _ O
of _ O
growth _ O

already _ O
contributing _ O
7% _ O

8% _ O
of _ O

, _ O
with _ O
the _ O
potential _ O
to _ O
grow _ O
to _ O
over _ O
13% _ O
by _ O
2028 _ O
. _ O

I _ O
am _ O
confident _ O
that _ O
DLF _ O
is _ O
eminently _ O
well-equipped _ O
to _ O
not _ O
only _ O
tide _ O
over _ O
the _ O
travails _ O
of _ O

but _ O
also _ O
be _ O
at _ O
the _ O
forefront _ O
of _ O
