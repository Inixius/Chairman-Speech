MESSAGE _ O
The _ O
year _ O
would _ O
also _ O
go _ O
down _ O
in _ O
Dabur _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
corporate _ O
history _ O
as _ O
one _ O
of _ O
transition _ O
with _ O
Mr _ O
. _ O

Sunil _ O
Duggal _ O
stepping _ O
down _ O
as _ O
CEO _ O
of _ O
the _ O
company _ O
, _ O
after _ O
a _ O
highly _ O
successful _ O
tenure _ O
of _ O
more _ O
than _ O
17 _ O
years _ O
. _ O

It _ O
would _ O
probably _ O
be _ O
one _ O
of _ O
the _ O
smoothest _ O
transitions _ O
ever _ O
witnessed _ O
in _ O
the _ O
history _ O
of _ O
Corporate _ O
India _ O
with _ O
Mr _ O
. _ O

Duggal _ O
handing _ O
over _ O
the _ O
baton _ O
to _ O
successor _ O
Mr _ O
. _ O

Mohit _ O
Malhotra _ O
, _ O
who _ O
has _ O
been _ O
a _ O
part _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Dabur _ O
family _ O
for _ O
over _ O
two _ O
decades _ O
now _ O
. _ O

It _ O
was _ O
a _ O
proud _ O
moment _ O
for _ O
me _ O
personally _ O
to _ O
see _ O
a _ O
home-grown _ O
young _ O
leader _ B-key
take _ O
charge _ O
at _ O
the _ O
helm _ O
of _ O
the _ O
company _ O
at _ O
the _ O
end _ O
of _ O
a _ O
structured _ O
succession _ O
planning _ O
process _ O
. _ O

This _ O
gives _ O
further _ O
credence _ O
to _ O
our _ O
commitment _ O
to _ O
professional _ O
management _ B-key
and _ O
adherence _ O
to _ O
the _ O
highest _ O
corporate _ O
governance _ O
standards _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
business _ O
front _ O
, _ O
we _ O
successfully _ O
navigated _ O
a _ O
rapidly _ O
changing _ O
regulatory _ O
landscape _ O
and _ O
intense _ O
competition _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
besides _ O
severe _ O
geopolitical _ O
headwinds _ O
and _ O
currency _ B-key
devaluations _ I-key
in _ O
parts _ O
of _ O
our _ O
international _ O
business _ O
. _ O

Despite _ O
these _ O
challenges _ O
, _ O
we _ O
succeeded _ O
in _ O
delivering _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
operating _ B-key
performance _ I-key
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
under _ O
review _ O
, _ O
our _ O
Consolidated _ B-key
Revenue _ I-key
grew _ O
by _ O
11% _ O
to _ O
8,533 _ O
Crore _ O
from _ O
7,748 _ O
Crore _ O
Tax _ B-key
was _ O
up _ O
6.5% _ O
to _ O
1,442 _ O
Crore _ O
. _ O

We _ O
invested _ B-key
strongly _ O
behind _ O
our _ O
business _ O
infrastructure _ O
to _ O
drive _ O
strong _ O
revenue _ B-key
growth _ O
, _ O
due _ O
to _ O
which _ O
our _ O
operating _ B-key
costs _ I-key
were _ O
a _ O
tad _ O
higher _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
also _ O
saw _ O
Dabur _ O
enhance _ O
its _ O
distribution _ O
footprint _ O
to _ O
6.7 _ O
million _ O
retail _ B-key
outlets _ O
across _ O
the _ O
country _ O
, _ O
with _ O
direct _ O
retail _ B-key
coverage _ O
increasing _ O
to _ O
1.1 _ O
million _ O
. _ O

Direct _ O
coverage _ O
indicates _ O
the _ O
retail _ B-key
outlets _ O
which _ O
are _ O
serviced _ O
through _ O
our _ O
own _ O
network _ B-key
of _ I-key
sales _ I-key
personnel _ O
and _ O
distributors _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Company _ O
also _ O
expanded _ O
its _ O
presence _ O
through _ O
newer _ O
distribution _ B-key
channels _ I-key
such _ O
as _ O
Modern _ O
Trade _ O
and _ O
E-commerce _ B-key
. _ O

We _ O
consolidated _ O
our _ O
rural _ O
reach _ O
by _ O
strengthening _ O
the _ O
front-end _ O
teams _ O
and _ O
super-stockist _ B-key
and _ O
sub-stockist _ B-key
network _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
also _ O
marked _ O
the _ O
implementation _ O
of _ O
Project _ O
Lakshya _ O
, _ O
an _ O
initiative _ O
aimed _ O
at _ O
improving _ O
in _ O
addition _ O
to _ O
making _ O
our _ O
supply _ B-key
chain _ I-key
future _ O
ready _ O
. _ O

Ayurveda _ O

continue _ O
to _ O
be _ O
game _ O
changers _ O
in _ O
the _ O

Dabur _ O
continues _ O

. _ O

To _ O
further _ O
enhance _ O
engagement _ O
in _ O
this _ O
space _ O
, _ O
we _ O
pioneered _ O
the _ O
concept _ O
of _ O
‘ _ O
Samvaad _ O

, _ O
a _ O

in _ O
our _ O

not _ O

the _ O

plants _ O
through _ O
sustainable _ O
cultivation _ O
. _ O

Under _ O
our _ O
biodiversity _ O

, _ O
we _ O
distributed _ O
nearly _ O
17.50 _ O
lakh _ O
saplings _ O
of _ O
medicinal _ O
herbs _ O
free _ O
of _ O

to _ O
farmers _ O
across _ O
the _ O
country _ O
, _ O
encouraging _ O
them _ O
to _ O
take _ O
up _ O
cultivation _ O
of _ O
herbs _ O
as _ O
an _ O
additional _ O
income _ B-key
generation _ O
activity _ O

Today _ O

6,100 _ O
acres _ O

land _ O
under _ O
