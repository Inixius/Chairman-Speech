Dear _ O
Shareholders _ B-key
, _ O
The _ O
mission _ O
to _ O
nurture _ O
health _ O
and _ O
protect _ O
priceless _ O
lives _ O
was _ O
at _ O
the _ O
core _ O
of _ O
our _ O
genesis _ O
in _ O
1983 _ O
; _ O
it _ O
is _ O
the _ O
reason _ O
we _ O
exist _ O
today _ O
. _ O

I _ O
told _ O
you _ O
earlier _ O
that _ O
the _ O
human _ O
body _ O
is _ O
Priceless _ O
; _ O
it _ O
is _ O
exactly _ O
for _ O
this _ O
reason _ O
that _ O
we _ O
at _ O
Apollo _ B-key
Hospitals _ I-key
, _ O
Value _ O
Life _ O
. _ O

Patients _ O
from _ O
over _ O
120 _ O
countries _ O
visit _ O
our _ O
Hospitals _ O
every _ O
year _ O
and _ O
our _ O
Group _ O
has _ O
touched _ O
over _ O
45 _ O
million _ O
lives _ O
in _ O
the _ O
last _ O
33 _ O
years _ O
. _ O

This _ O
incredible _ O
journey _ O
has _ O
taught _ O
us _ O
we _ O
should _ O
stop _ O
at _ O
nothing _ O
to _ O
do _ O
what _ O
we _ O
can _ O
to _ O
protect _ O
our _ O
patient _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
health _ B-key
and _ O
well _ B-key
being _ I-key
. _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
we _ O
have _ O
a _ O
responsibility _ O
to _ O
help _ O
them _ O
fight _ O
the _ O
pain _ O
of _ O
disease _ B-key
and _ O
to _ O
give _ O
them _ O
the _ O
most _ O
appropriate _ O
treatment _ O
to _ O
put _ O
them _ O
on _ O
the _ O
road _ O
to _ O
recovery _ O
. _ O

For _ O
over _ O
three _ O
decades _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
inspired _ O
by _ O
the _ O
dream _ O
of _ O
a _ O
healthy _ O
India _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
taken _ O
several _ O
transformative _ O
steps _ O
towards _ O
this _ O
goal _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
drive _ O
is _ O
powered _ O
by _ O
our _ O
deep _ O
respect _ O
for _ O
the _ O
power _ O
of _ O
good _ O
health _ O
and _ O
the _ O
miracle _ O
of _ O
the _ O
human _ O
body _ O
. _ O

Without _ O
good _ O
health _ O
, _ O
we _ O
know _ O
that _ O
life _ O
stands _ O
on _ O
a _ O
brittle _ O
foundation _ B-key
. _ O

We _ O
therefore _ O
seek _ O
to _ O
educate _ O
people _ O
on _ O
the _ O
importance _ O
of _ O
Preventive _ O
Health _ O
to _ O
protect _ O
them _ O
from _ O
a _ O
potentially _ O
uncontrollable _ O
disease _ O
burden _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
commitment _ O
to _ O
health _ O
and _ O
our _ O
philosophy _ O
of _ O
valuing _ O
life—our _ O
defining _ O
legacy—is _ O
epitomized _ O
by _ O
our _ O
every _ O
day _ O
practices _ O
and _ O
performance _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
Hospitals _ O
have _ O
led _ O

In _ O
the _ O

treatment _ I-key
meant _ O
access _ O
to _ O

in _ O
the _ O

. _ O

The _ O

has _ O
turned _ O
a _ O
full _ O
circle _ O
; _ O
today _ O
, _ O
we _ O
offer _ O
healthcare _ O
in _ O
India _ O
that _ O
is _ O
as _ O

as _ O
any _ O

at _ O

At _ O

Every _ O

Building _ O

at _ O

At _ O
Apollo _ O
Hospitals _ O
, _ O
our _ O
approach _ O
to _ O

is _ O
shaped _ O
by _ O
one _ O
powerful _ O
truth _ O
- _ O
Life _ O
is _ O
precious _ O
, _ O
life _ O
is _ O
Priceless _ O
. _ O

The _ O
value _ O
we _ O
have _ O
for _ O
the _ O
miracle _ O
of _ O
human _ O
life _ O
inspires _ O
us _ O
to _ O
stretch _ O
our _ O
boundaries _ O
to _ O
the _ O
maximum _ O
possible _ O
. _ O

It _ O
provides _ O
us _ O
the _ O

as _ O
we _ O
can _ O
in _ O

for _ O

The _ O
mission _ O
to _ O
touch _ O

nothing _ O

In _ O
line _ O
with _ O
our _ O
stated _ O
objective _ O
of _ O

, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
added _ O

1,700 _ O

We _ O
also _ O
acquired _ O
a _ O

profitable _ O
210 _ O

during _ O
the _ O

to _ O

Further _ O
in _ O

Our _ O
success _ O
on _ O
this _ O

has _ O
been _ O
as _ O
a _ O
result _ O
of _ O
a _ O

of _ O

the _ O

of _ O
