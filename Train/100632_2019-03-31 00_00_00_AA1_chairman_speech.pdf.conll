19 _ O
It _ O
is _ O
now _ O
very _ O
evident _ O
that _ O
we _ O
live _ O
in _ O
an _ O
era _ O
of _ O
continuous _ O
and _ O
rapid _ O
disruption _ O
. _ O

Yet _ O
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
hard _ O
not _ O
to _ O
feel _ O
empathy _ O
for _ O
incumbents _ B-key
who _ O
are _ O
besieged _ O
every _ O
day _ O
with _ O
reports _ O
of _ O
doomsday _ B-key
scenarios _ I-key
and _ O
menacing _ B-key
trends _ I-key
that _ O
seem _ O
to _ O
challenge _ O
their _ O
very _ O
existence _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
very _ O
difficult _ O
to _ O
sift _ O
the _ O
signal _ O
from _ O
the _ O
noise _ O
, _ O
to _ O
separate _ O
the _ O
genuine _ O
disruption _ B-key
from _ O
the _ O
hype _ B-key
cycle _ I-key
which _ O
will _ O
disappear _ O
in _ O
the _ O
next _ O
round _ O
of _ O
news _ O
. _ O

It _ O
is _ O
also _ O
not _ O
easy _ O
to _ O
tell _ O
if _ O
the _ O
shift _ O
is _ O
in _ O
the _ O
distant _ O
horizon _ O
or _ O
is _ O
imminent _ O
and _ O
in _ O
your _ O
face _ O

At _ O
Infosys _ O

We _ O
are _ O
seeing _ O
like _ O
never _ O
before _ O
, _ O
that _ O
distribution _ O
is _ O
power _ O
. _ O

Digital _ B-key
natives _ I-key
are _ O
using _ O
their _ O
Direct _ O
to _ O
Consumer _ O
channels _ O
to _ O
create _ O
learning _ B-key
machines _ I-key
that _ O
let _ O
them _ O
gain _ O
an _ O
acute _ O
understanding _ O
of _ O
their _ O
consumers _ O
, _ O
and _ O
create _ O
unique _ O
, _ O
continually _ O
improving _ B-key
experiences _ I-key
for _ O
each _ O
of _ O
them _ O
. _ O

Platform _ B-key
companies _ I-key
are _ O
bringing _ O
customers _ O
more _ O
choices _ O
by _ O
moving _ O
quickly _ O
into _ O
adjacencies _ O
or _ O
by _ O
unbundling _ O
traditional _ O
value _ B-key
chains _ I-key
to _ O
reassemble _ O
new _ O
business _ B-key
models _ I-key
where _ O
the _ O
source _ O
of _ O
revenue _ B-key
is _ O
completely _ O
different _ O

to _ O
cheap _ B-key
capital _ I-key
is _ O
creating _ O
new _ O
competitors _ O
playing _ O
by _ O
different _ O
rules _ O
. _ O

Underlying _ O
it _ O
all _ O
is _ O
a _ O
tsunami _ O
of _ O
data _ O
that _ O
is _ O
unrivalled _ O
in _ O
business _ B-key
history _ I-key
for _ O
its _ O
velocity _ O

volume _ O
and _ O
variety _ O
, _ O
further _ O
amplified _ O
by _ O

Incumbents _ O
need _ O
not _ O
be _ O
fazed _ O
by _ O
this _ O
disruption _ O
. _ O

The _ O
markets _ B-key
have _ O
always _ O
rewarded _ B-key
businesses _ I-key
that _ O
display _ O
an _ O
understanding _ O
of _ O
these _ O
shifts _ O
and _ O
act _ O
boldly _ O
in _ O

. _ O

We _ O
want _ O
to _ O
contribute _ O

this _ O
new _ O
world _ O

. _ O

Over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
year _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
been _ O
working _ O
relentlessly _ O
to _ O
rebuild _ O
a _ O
200,000 _ O

organization _ O
to _ O
operate _ O
with _ O
the _ O
speed _ O

agility _ B-key
of _ I-key
a _ I-key

. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
reforming _ O

We _ O
are _ O
seeking _ O
to _ O
be _ O

in _ O
our _ O
responses _ O
to _ O
a _ O

external _ O
environment _ O
, _ O
and _ O
with _ O
it _ O
to _ O
increase _ O
the _ O
