What _ O
were _ O
the _ O
reasons _ O
of _ O
this _ O
unfortunate _ O
performance _ O
? _ O

Broadly _ O
speaking _ O
, _ O
your _ O
company _ O
went _ O
through _ O
what _ O
is _ O
called _ O
a _ O
‘ _ O
perfect _ O
storm _ O
’ _ O
when _ O
several _ O
negative _ O
factors _ O
simultaneously _ O
came _ O
into _ O
play _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
us _ O
briefl _ O
y _ O
discuss _ O
each _ O
of _ O
these _ O
. _ O

The _ O
fi _ O
rst _ O
was _ O
related _ O
to _ O
the _ O
US _ O
Food _ O
and _ O
Drug _ O
Administration _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
( _ O
USFDA _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
) _ O
inspections _ O
. _ O

In _ O
November _ O
2014 _ O
and _ O
March _ O
2015 _ O
, _ O
the _ O
regulator _ O
inspected _ O
three _ O
of _ O
our _ O
plants _ O
: _ O
two _ O
chemical _ O
units _ O
that _ O
manufacture _ O
active _ B-key
pharmaceutical _ I-key
ingredients _ I-key
( _ I-key
APIs _ I-key
) _ I-key
at _ O
Srikakulam _ O
and _ O
Miryalaguda _ O
, _ O
and _ O
our _ O
formulations _ O
plant _ O
at _ O
Duvadda _ O
, _ O
near _ O
Visakhapatnam _ O
, _ O
which _ O
is _ O
an _ O
oncological _ O
sterile _ O
injectable _ O
facility _ O
with _ O
the _ O
capacity _ O
to _ O
manufacture _ O
certain _ O
complex _ O
generics _ O
. _ O

Based _ O
on _ O
their _ O
inspection _ O
, _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
sent _ O
a _ O
warning _ O
letter _ O
to _ O
your _ O
company _ O
in _ O
November _ O
2015 _ O
. _ O

We _ O
responded _ O
with _ O
a _ O
comprehensive _ O
plan _ O
of _ O
corrective _ O
and _ O
remedial _ O
actions _ O
along _ O
with _ O
timelines _ O
. _ O

Based _ O
on _ O
our _ O
corrective _ O
actions _ O
, _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
re-inspected _ O
these _ O
three _ O
plants _ O
between _ O
February _ O
2017 _ O
and _ O
April _ O
2017 _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
received _ O
some _ O
observations _ O
from _ O
the _ O
regulator _ O
thereafter _ O
, _ O
and _ O
have _ O
subsequently _ O
submitted _ O
a _ O
detailed _ O
response _ O
. _ O

At _ O
present _ O
, _ O
we _ O
await _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
views _ O
on _ O
our _ O
latest _ O
set _ O
of _ O
responses _ O
. _ O

There _ O
is _ O
no _ O
doubt _ O
that _ O
the _ O
remedial _ O
actions _ O
triggered _ O
by _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
observations _ O
is _ O
unmistakably _ O
benefi _ O
cial _ O
to _ O
Dr _ O
. _ O

Reddy _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
in _ O
the _ O
long _ O
run _ O
and _ O
that _ O
it _ O
has _ O
helped _ O
us _ O
to _ O
accelerate _ O
the _ O
pace _ O
of _ O
quality _ O
reforms _ O
across _ O
our _ O
plants _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
, _ O
since _ O
November _ O
2015 _ O
, _ O
signifi _ O
cantly _ O
invested _ O
in _ O
processes _ O
, _ O
automation _ O
, _ O
detailed _ O
documentation _ O
of _ O
each _ O
batch _ O
and _ O
standard _ O
operating _ O
procedures _ O
, _ O
and _ O
have _ O
further _ O
strengthened _ O
our _ O
quality _ B-key
management _ I-key
systems _ I-key
. _ O

We _ O
also _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
the _ O
shift _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
regulator _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
approach _ O
from _ O
‘ _ O
what _ O
has _ O
gone _ O
wrong _ O
’ _ O
to _ O
‘ _ O
what _ O
can _ O
go _ O
wrong _ O
’ _ O
is _ O
for _ O
the _ O
long _ O
term _ O
good _ O
of _ O
the _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

Equally _ O
, _ O
however _ O
, _ O
the _ O
warning _ O
letter _ O
put _ O
on _ O
hold _ O
the _ O
approval _ O
of _ O
several _ O
key _ O
drugs _ O
, _ O
including _ O
high _ O
value _ O
added _ O
injectables _ O
and _ O
complex _ O
generics _ O
, _ O
to _ O
the _ O
US _ O
from _ O
the _ O
last _ O
quarter _ O
of _ O
FY2016 _ O
and _ O
throughout _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

This _ O
pipeline _ B-key
blockage _ I-key
affected _ O
revenues _ B-key
, _ O
margins _ B-key
and _ O
profi _ B-key
ts _ I-key
. _ O

Additional _ O
costs _ O
of _ O
conducting _ O
remedial _ O
work _ O
, _ O
including _ O
the _ O
use _ O
of _ O
international _ O
consultants _ O
, _ O
also _ O
reduced _ O
profi _ O
ts _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
factor _ O
was _ O
the _ O
intensive _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
competition _ O
in _ O
US _ O
from _ O
several _ O
other _ O
global _ O
generics _ O
players _ O
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
on _ O
account _ O
of _ O
two _ O
reasons _ O
: _ O
new _ O
competitors _ O
launching _ O
some _ O
of _ O
our _ O
niche _ O
and _ O
high _ O
salience _ O
drugs _ O
and _ O
dramatically _ O
pushing _ O
prices _ O
down _ O
; _ O
and _ O
the _ O
signifi _ O
cant _ O
consolidation _ O
of _ O
our _ O
key _ O
US _ O
trade _ B-key
channels _ I-key
which _ O
gave _ O
the _ O
buyers _ O
greater _ O
pricing _ O
power _ O
than _ O
before _ O
. _ O

Moreover _ O
, _ O
a _ O
high _ B-key
value _ I-key
multi-year _ I-key
supply _ I-key
contract _ I-key
from _ O
our _ O
US _ O
manufacturing _ B-key
facility _ I-key
, _ O
expired _ O
during _ O
the _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Third _ O
, _ O
there _ O
were _ O
signifi _ O
cant _ O
delays _ O
in _ O
USFDA _ O
approvals _ O
and _ O
the _ O
consequent _ O
launch _ O
of _ O
new _ O
products _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
. _ O

These _ O
have _ O
nothing _ O
to _ O
do _ O
with _ O
the _ O
warning _ O
letters _ O
regarding _ O
our _ O
three _ O
facilities _ O
. _ O

Instead _ O
, _ O
these _ O
are _ O
on _ O
account _ O
on _ O
several _ O
additional _ O
queries _ O
raised _ O
by _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
– _ O
not _ O
just _ O
to _ O
us _ O
but _ O
all _ O
global _ O
pharmaceutical _ O
companies _ O
. _ O

Added _ O
to _ O
these _ O
deferrals _ O
were _ O
intellectual _ O
property _ O
litigations _ O
on _ O
some _ O
of _ O
our _ O
complex _ O
generics _ O
products _ O
. _ O

Fourth _ O
, _ O
as _ O
an _ O
industry _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
facing _ O
government _ O
inspired _ O
pricing _ O
pressures _ O
in _ O
emerging _ O
and _ O
even _ O
the _ O
developed _ O
markets _ B-key
. _ O

Regulators _ O
have _ O
become _ O
ever _ O
more _ O
vigilant _ O
of _ O
price _ O
increases _ O
taken _ O
by _ O
pharmaceutical _ O

In _ O

are _ O

This _ O
will _ O

The _ O

with _ O
what _ O
was _ O
once _ O
an _ O
excellently _ O
profi _ O
table _ O
emerging _ O
market _ O
, _ O
Venezuela _ O
. _ O

Till _ O
two _ O
years _ O
ago _ O
, _ O
your _ O
company _ O
enjoyed _ O
a _ O
sound _ O
business _ O
in _ O
providing _ O
affordable _ O
medicine _ O
to _ O
that _ O
country _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
an _ O
increasingly _ O
severe _ O
economic _ B-key
crisis _ I-key
in _ O
Venezuela _ O
has _ O
led _ O
to _ O
the _ O
government _ O
imposing _ O
severe _ O
constraints _ O
on _ O
foreign _ O
exchange _ O
outfl _ O
ows _ O
. _ O

Those _ O
familiar _ O
with _ O
last _ O
year _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
annual _ B-key
report _ I-key
will _ O
know _ O
that _ O
we _ O
took _ O
a _ O
major _ O
write-down _ O
of _ O
the _ O
net _ O
monetary _ O
assets _ O
of _ O
our _ O
Venezuelan _ O
business _ O
in _ O
FY2016 _ O
. _ O

Thereafter _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
consciously _ O
chosen _ O
to _ O
limit _ O
our _ O
business _ O
to _ O
supplying _ O
consignments _ O
only _ O
against _ O
remittance _ O
of _ O
funds _ O
from _ O
Venezuela _ O
. _ O

Since _ O
such _ O
repatriations _ O
are _ O
minuscule _ O
, _ O
so _ O
too _ O
is _ O
the _ O
size _ O
of _ O
our _ O
business _ O
. _ O

Finally _ O
, _ O
our _ O
active _ O
pharmaceutical _ O
ingredients _ O
business _ O
was _ O
also _ O
impacted _ O
due _ O
to _ O
lower _ O
off-take _ O
of _ O
some _ O
key _ O
molecules _ O
. _ O

These _ O
six _ O
factors _ O
came _ O
together _ O
; _ O
worked _ O
contemporaneously _ O
throughout _ O
FY2017 _ O
; _ O
and _ O
severely _ O
affected _ O
both _ O
revenue _ B-key
and _ O
profi _ B-key
ts _ I-key
. _ O

What _ O
are _ O
the _ O
bright _ O
spots _ O
? _ O

And _ O
where _ O
do _ O
we _ O
go _ O
from _ O
here _ O
? _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
the _ O
pricing _ O
pressures _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
market _ O
will _ O
be _ O
less _ O
severe _ O
and _ O
more _ O
calibrated _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
. _ O

We _ O
also _ O
have _ O
an _ O
excellent _ O
pipeline _ O
of _ O
complex _ O
generics _ O
to _ O
be _ O
introduced _ O
to _ O
the _ O
country _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
, _ O
and _ O
expect _ O
to _ O
do _ O
better _ O
through _ O
this _ O
effective _ O
upgrade _ O
of _ O
our _ O
portfolio _ O
mix _ O
. _ O

We _ O
also _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
there _ O
are _ O
enormous _ O
opportunities _ O
across _ O
emerging _ O
markets _ O
, _ O
and _ O
are _ O
playing _ O
actively _ O
to _ O
increase _ O
our _ O
presence _ O
in _ O
these _ O
territories _ O
through _ O
complex _ O
generics _ O
and _ O
biosimilars _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Russian _ O
and _ O
CIS _ O
markets _ O
are _ O
on _ O
a _ O
moderate _ O
upswing _ O
. _ O

Though _ O
threats _ O
of _ O
government-induced _ O
pricing _ O
pressure _ O
remain _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
seeing _ O
greater _ O
offtake _ O
of _ O
generics _ O
– _ O
both _ O
relatively _ O
simple _ O
and _ O
complex _ O
– _ O
and _ O
oncological _ O
biosimilars _ O
, _ O
the _ O
latter _ O
through _ O
greater _ O
hospital _ O
and _ O
institutional _ O
sales _ O
. _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
emerging _ O
markets _ B-key
will _ O
again _ O
get _ O
back _ O
to _ O
double-digit _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

Despite _ O
government _ O
induced _ O
pricing _ O
pressures _ O
on _ O
pharmaceutical _ B-key
products _ I-key
, _ O
India _ O
remains _ O
a _ O
high _ B-key
growth _ I-key
market _ I-key
. _ O

In _ O
FY2017 _ O
, _ O
revenues _ O
grew _ O
by _ O
9% _ O
over _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
fi _ O
rst _ O
quarter _ O
of _ O
FY2018 _ O
may _ O
witness _ O
a _ O
temporary _ O
decline _ O
in _ O
the _ O
sales _ O
due _ O
to _ O
de-stocking _ O
by _ O
trade _ O
on _ O
the _ O
implementation _ O
of _ O
Goods _ B-key
and _ I-key
Services _ I-key
Tax _ I-key
( _ I-key
GST _ I-key
) _ I-key
. _ O

Post _ O
normalisation _ O
, _ O
we _ O
expect _ O
to _ O
grow _ O
at _ O
low _ O
double-digits _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
and _ O
for _ O
the _ O
foreseeable _ O
future _ O
. _ O

Having _ O
striven _ O
to _ O
widen _ O
our _ O
European _ O
footprint _ O
from _ O
the _ O
UK _ O
and _ O
Germany _ O
to _ O
France _ O
, _ O
Italy _ O
and _ O
Spain _ O
, _ O
we _ O
expect _ O
more _ O
signifi _ O
cant _ O
growth _ O
from _ O
the _ O
continent _ O
in _ O
the _ O
years _ O
to _ O
come _ O
. _ O

We _ O
are _ O
particularly _ O
proud _ O
of _ O
our _ O
relatively _ O
nascent _ O
proprietary _ B-key
products _ I-key
business _ I-key
. _ O

The _ O
focus _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
was _ O
on _ O
the _ O
commercialization _ O
of _ O
our _ O
newly _ O
launched _ O
products _ O
: _ O
ZembraceTM _ O
SymTouchTM _ O
( _ O
a _ O
3 _ O
mg _ O
sumatriptan _ O
injection _ O
for _ O
acute _ O
migraine _ O
) _ O
and _ O
SernivoTM _ O
( _ O
a _ O
betamethasone _ O
dipropionate _ O
0.05% _ O
spray _ O
to _ O
treat _ O
mild-to-moderate _ O
plaque _ O
psoriasis _ O
) _ O
. _ O

We _ O
shall _ O
attempt _ O
to _ O
signifi _ O
cantly _ O
drive _ O
the _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
these _ O
products _ O
while _ O
introducing _ O
new _ O
products _ O
from _ O
our _ O
healthy _ O
pipeline _ O
. _ O

Perhaps _ O
the _ O
most _ O
signifi _ O
cant _ O
aspect _ O
of _ O
the _ O
top-line _ O
crunch _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
is _ O
that _ O
it _ O
forced _ O
us _ O
to _ O
carefully _ O
look _ O
at _ O
all _ O
elements _ O
of _ O
costs _ O
and _ O
administrative _ O
layers _ O
– _ O
items _ O
that _ O
inexorably _ O
build _ O
up _ O
in _ O
good _ O
times _ O
and _ O
are _ O
generally _ O
only _ O
confronted _ O
in _ O
periods _ O
of _ O
stress _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
started _ O
multiple _ O
, _ O
company-wide _ O
projects _ O
to _ O
lop _ O
off _ O
costs _ O
without _ O
affecting _ O
productivity _ O
and _ O
, _ O
in _ O
doing _ O
so _ O
, _ O
recreate _ O
a _ O
leaner _ O
and _ O
more _ O
nimble _ O
global _ O
enterprise _ O
. _ O

No _ O
chairman _ O
of _ O
a _ O
company _ O
listed _ O
in _ O
India _ O
and _ O
the _ O
US _ O
should _ O
ever _ O
make _ O
forward-looking _ O
statements _ O
. _ O

Even _ O
so _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
tempted _ O
to _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
your _ O
company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
performance _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
will _ O
be _ O
better _ O
than _ O
what _ O
we _ O
saw _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
us _ O
indeed _ O
hope _ O
that _ O
it _ O
will _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
a _ O
good _ O
of _ O
