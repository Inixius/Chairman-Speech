The _ O

grace—even _ O
in _ O
the _ O

We _ O
have _ O
struggled _ O
to _ O
name _ O
this _ O
human _ O
trait _ O

the _ O
universal _ O

that _ O

the _ O

is _ O
truly _ O
what _ O
defines _ O
India _ O
and _ O
its _ O
resiliency _ O

Add _ O
to _ O
this _ O
the _ O
fact _ O
that _ O
the _ O
government _ O
is _ O
now _ O
able _ O

carry _ O

start _ O
seeing _ O
the _ O

of _ O
the _ O

that _ O
had _ O
the _ O
vision _ O
to _ O
put _ O

The _ O
Possibilities _ O
Sitting _ O
where _ O
we _ O
are _ O
today _ O
, _ O
I _ O
can _ O
say _ O
that _ O
history _ O
is _ O
in _ O
process _ O
of _ O
being _ O
scripted _ O

I _ O
will _ O
be _ O
the _ O
first _ O
to _ O
admit _ O
that _ O
I _ O
have _ O
no _ O
way _ O
of _ O
predicting _ O
the _ O
short _ O
or _ O
mid-term _ O
possible _ O
economic _ B-key
outcomes _ O
as _ O
a _ O
result _ O
of _ O
COVID _ B-key

. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
there _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
any _ O
denying _ O
the _ O
fact _ O
that _ O
India _ O
, _ O
over _ O
the _ O
next _ O
several _ O
decades _ O
, _ O
will _ O
be _ O
a _ O
market _ B-key
continuously _ O
on _ O
the _ O
up _ O
and _ O
one _ O
that _ O
simply _ O
cannot _ O
be _ O
ignored _ O

It _ O
will _ O
be _ O

of _ O

If _ O
there _ O
was _ O
a _ O
time _ O
to _ O
make _ O
a _ O
bet _ O
on _ O

there _ O
may _ O
not _ O

a _ O
better _ O

What _ O
I _ O
can _ O
predict _ O
is _ O
that _ O
on _ O
the _ O

that _ O

some _ O

what _ O
the _ O

most _ O
certainly _ O
post _ O

is _ O
the _ O
