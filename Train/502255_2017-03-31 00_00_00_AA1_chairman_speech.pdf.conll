The _ O

Chairman _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
statement _ O
The _ O
philosophy _ O
of _ O
this _ O
great _ O
visionary _ O
appears _ O
more _ O
relevant _ O
now _ O
than _ O
ever _ O
before _ O
. _ O

India _ O
stands _ O
at _ O
a _ O
rare _ O
inflection _ O
in _ O
its _ O
existence _ O
when _ O
there _ O
is _ O
a _ O
coming _ O
together _ O
of _ O
political _ O
stability _ O
, _ O
national _ O
vision _ O
and _ O
economic _ O
reforms _ O
. _ O

We _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
India _ O
will _ O
retain _ O
its _ O
position _ O
as _ O
the _ O
world _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
fastest _ O
growing _ O
economy _ O
; _ O
from _ O
a _ O
sectoral _ O
perspective _ O
this _ O
means _ O
that _ O
there _ O
will _ O
be _ O
larger _ O
demand _ O
for _ O
electricity _ O
; _ O
the _ O
conventional _ O
preference _ O
for _ O
generating _ O
electricity _ O
will _ O
have _ O
to _ O
be _ O
balanced _ O
with _ O
a _ O
corresponding _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
power _ O
transmission _ O
sector _ O
investments _ O
. _ O

India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
transmission _ O
network _ O
as _ O
on _ O
March _ O
2017 _ O
was _ O
367851 _ O
circuit _ O
kilometers _ O
of _ O
transmission _ O
and _ O
740765 _ O
MVA _ O
of _ O
sub-station _ O
capacity _ O
fed _ O
by _ O
326.8 _ O
GW _ O
of _ O
generating _ O
capacity _ O
as _ O
in _ O
March _ O
2017 _ O
. _ O

While _ O
generation _ O
has _ O
grown _ O
more _ O
than _ O
11% _ O
since _ O
March _ O
2011 _ O
, _ O
transmission _ O
capacity _ O
has _ O
grown _ O
less _ O
than _ O
7% _ O
since _ O
then _ O
. _ O

The _ O
ratio _ O
of _ O
investment _ O
in _ O
transmission _ O
and _ O
distribution _ O
to _ O
power _ O
generation _ O
has _ O
remained _ O
at _ O
less _ O
than _ O
50% _ O
. _ O

The _ O
long-standing _ O
skew _ O
between _ O
power _ O
generation _ O
and _ O
transmission _ O
is _ O
now _ O
reflected _ O
in _ O
regional _ O
imbalances _ O
. _ O

Northern _ O
and _ O
Southern _ O
India _ O
are _ O
expected _ O
to _ O
suffer _ O
an _ O
aggregate _ O
deficit _ O
of _ O
31.5 _ O
to _ O
41.1 _ O
GW _ O
and _ O
13 _ O
to _ O
19.1 _ O
GW _ O
respectively _ O
. _ O

It _ O
will _ O
thus _ O
become _ O
imperative _ O
to _ O
import _ O
power _ O
from _ O
power _ O
- _ O
surplus _ O
regions _ O
in _ O
India _ O
. _ O

With _ O
this _ O
in _ O
view _ O
, _ O
we _ O
believe _ O
that _ O
the _ O
Central _ O
Government _ O
will _ O
make _ O
unprecedented _ O
investments _ O
to _ O
raise _ O
inter-regional _ O
transmission _ O
capacity _ O
from _ O
59.5 _ O
GW _ O
in _ O
March _ O
2016 _ O
to _ O
91 _ O
GW _ O
in _ O
March _ O
2022 _ O
. _ O

Besides _ O
, _ O
India _ O
plans _ O
to _ O
increase _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
capacity _ O
from _ O
57 _ O
GW _ O
in _ O
FY2016 _ O
- _ O
2017 _ O
to _ O
175 _ O
GW _ O
by _ O
2022 _ O

global _ O
investments _ O
in _ O
renewable _ O
energy _ O
, _ O
warranting _ O
specialised _ O
corridors _ O
for _ O

. _ O

This _ O
increase _ O
will _ O
be _ O
in _ O

to _ O
a _ O

share _ O
of _ O

8 _ O
this _ O

priority _ O
with _ O
the _ O
urgency _ O

It _ O
has _ O
