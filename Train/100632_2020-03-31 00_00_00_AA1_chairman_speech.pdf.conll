The _ O

to _ O
serve _ O
the _ O
changing _ O
needs _ O
of _ O
the _ O
enterprise _ O

its _ O

That _ O

We _ O
’ _ O
ve _ O
often _ O
heard _ O
it _ O
said _ O
that _ O
disruption _ O
creeps _ O
up _ O
on _ O
us _ O
gradually _ O
, _ O
then _ O
suddenly _ O
. _ O

But _ O
disruption _ O
can _ O
also _ O
play _ O
out _ O
suddenly _ O
, _ O
then _ O
gradually _ O

Many _ O
companies _ O
, _ O
even _ O
in _ O
the _ O
face _ O
of _ O
operational _ O
challenges _ O
through _ O
the _ O
sudden _ O
recent _ O
crisis _ O
, _ O
stepped _ O
up _ O
with _ O
relative _ O
ease _ O

How _ O

across _ O
46 _ O
countries _ O
, _ O
to _ O
work _ O
from _ O

offers _ O
a _ O
fine _ O
illustration _ O
of _ O
this _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
remote _ O
access _ O
infrastructure _ O
was _ O
expanded _ O
10x _ O
for _ O
virtual _ B-key
private _ I-key
network _ I-key
bandwidth _ O
and _ O
backend _ O
capacity _ O
scaled _ O
by _ O
4x _ O
to _ O
support _ O
the _ O
increase _ O
in _ O
concurrent _ O

users _ O
. _ O

As _ O
many _ O
as _ O
35,000 _ O
assets _ O
were _ O
moved _ O
to _ O
employee _ O
residences _ O
, _ O
and _ O
several _ O
more _ O
personal _ O
devices _ O
were _ O
enabled _ O
with _ O
wireless _ O
connectivity _ O
to _ O
securely _ O
connect _ O
with _ O

networks _ I-key
. _ O

Cloud-based _ O
remote _ O
audio _ O
, _ O
video _ O
and _ O
content _ O
collaboration _ O
platforms _ O
are _ O
integral _ O
to _ O
this _ O
landscape _ O
. _ O

With _ O
over _ O
85% _ O
of _ O
our _ O
workforce _ O
already _ O
enabled _ O
for _ O
distributed _ O
agile _ O
working _ O
and _ O
with _ O
over _ O
10,000 _ O
scrum _ O
masters _ O
in _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
, _ O
remote _ O
development _ O

proved _ O
less _ O
of _ O
a _ O

The _ O
InfyMe _ O
app _ O
continues _ O
to _ O

all _ O
Infosys _ O
employees _ O
to _ O
the _ O

while _ O
allowing _ O
them _ O
to _ O
self-declare _ O
their _ O
health _ O
status _ O
. _ O

Meanwhile _ O
, _ O
over _ O
9,000 _ O
trainees _ O
and _ O
interns _ O
relocated _ O
to _ O
their _ O
homes _ O
from _ O
our _ O
residential _ O
Global _ O
Education _ O
Center _ O
in _ O
Mysuru _ O
, _ O
India _ O
. _ O

They _ O
are _ O
all _ O
enabled _ O
to _ O
continue _ O
training _ O
on _ O
our _ O
digital _ B-key
learning _ I-key
platform _ I-key
, _ O
Lex _ O

In _ O
addition _ O
to _ O
bite-sized _ O
content _ O
from _ O
the _ O
Foundation _ O
Program _ O
, _ O
Lex _ O
brings _ O
trainer-led _ O
lessons _ O
, _ O
a _ O
hands-on _ O
lab _ O
environment _ O
and _ O
even _ O
proctored _ O
internal _ O
certifications _ O
– _ O
all _ O
virtually _ O
– _ O
to _ O
the _ O
homes _ O
of _ O
learners _ O
. _ O

Much _ O
of _ O
this _ O
has _ O
been _ O
made _ O
possible _ O
by _ O
our _ O
digital _ O
transformation _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
two _ O
years _ O
– _ O
enabled _ O
by _ O
our _ O
virtual _ B-key
workspaces _ I-key
, _ O
secure _ B-key
polycloud _ I-key
environment _ I-key
, _ O
micro-survey _ B-key
services _ I-key
for _ O
our _ O
digital _ B-key
platforms _ I-key
, _ O
services _ O
curated _ O
in _ O
our _ O
service _ O
store _ O
and _ O
tools _ O
for _ O
remote _ O
collaboration _ O
. _ O

But _ O
the _ O
real _ O
test _ O
will _ O
come _ O
in _ O
the _ O
following _ O
months _ O
when _ O
we _ O
must _ O
find _ O
ways _ O
to _ O
understand _ O
and _ O
respond _ O
to _ O
the _ O
gradually _ O
evolving _ O
dynamics _ O
of _ O
the _ O
new _ O
normal _ O
. _ O

Technology _ O
will _ O
prove _ O
an _ O
ally _ O
here _ O
. _ O

That _ O
said _ O
, _ O
building _ O
systems _ O
and _ O
operating _ B-key
models _ I-key
at _ O
enterprise _ O
- _ O
scale _ O
is _ O
an _ O
exercise _ O
in _ O
factoring _ O
scale _ O
intrinsically _ O
into _ O
the _ O
design _ O
of _ O
solutions _ O
. _ O

For _ O
example _ O
, _ O
our _ O
systems _ O
were _ O
severely _ O
tested _ O
in _ O
their _ O
ability _ O
to _ O
scale _ O
when _ O
for _ O
a _ O
multinational _ O
telecommunications _ O
company _ O
, _ O
we _ O
leveraged _ O
Launchpad _ O
, _ O
our _ O
remote _ O
employee _ O

platform _ O
, _ O
to _ O
include _ O
their _ O
employees _ O
, _ O
spread _ O
across _ O
three _ O
countries _ O
, _ O
into _ O
a _ O
new _ O
project _ O
environment _ O
with _ O
access _ O
to _ O
over _ O
200 _ O
IT _ O
applications _ O
, _ O
network _ O
operations _ O
and _ O
six _ O
large _ O
data _ O
centers _ O
connecting _ O
~ _ O
16,000 _ O
servers _ O
. _ O

For _ O
another _ O
American _ O
multinational _ O
in _ O
the _ O
food _ O
business _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
now _ O
leveraging _ O
our _ O
Live _ O
Enterprise _ O
Application _ O
Platform _ O
to _ O
enable _ O
remote _ O
knowledge _ O
transfer _ O
for _ O
their _ O
global _ O
project _ O
teams _ O
while _ O
digitizing _ O
all _ O
their _ O
