Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
IndiGo _ O
commenced _ O
operations _ O
over _ O
a _ O
decade _ O
ago _ O
as _ O
a _ O
low _ O
cost _ O
carrier _ O
with _ O
a _ O
very _ O
clear _ O
purpose _ O
of _ O
providing _ O
a _ O
superior _ O
quality _ O
product _ O
along _ O
with _ O
a _ O
hassle _ O
free _ O
experience _ O
for _ O
its _ O
customers _ O
. _ O

Today _ O
we _ O
can _ O
proudly _ O
say _ O
that _ O
we _ O
have _ O
lived _ O
up _ O
to _ O
this _ O
dream _ O
and _ O
are _ O
striving _ O
to _ O
get _ O
better _ O
every _ O
single _ O
day _ O
. _ O

IndiGo _ O
today _ O
is _ O
not _ O
just _ O
seen _ O
as _ O
an _ O
airline _ O
but _ O
as _ O
a _ O
major _ O
force _ O
driving _ O
the _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
this _ O
country _ O
. _ O

These _ O
contributions _ O
are _ O
taking _ O
place _ O
across _ O
multiple _ O
fronts _ O
creating _ O
a _ O
positive _ O
impact _ O
on _ O
the _ O
lives _ O
of _ O
millions _ O
of _ O
people _ O
across _ O
India _ O
. _ O

We _ O
provide _ O
access _ O
to _ O
smaller _ O
cities _ O
India _ O
has _ O
numerous _ O
small _ O
to _ O
medium _ O
cities _ O
spread _ O
over _ O
a _ O
large _ O
land _ O
mass _ O
and _ O
access _ O
to _ O
these _ O
cities _ O
is _ O
not _ O
easy _ O
. _ O

We _ O
want _ O
customers _ O
to _ O
pick _ O
IndiGo _ O
not _ O
only _ O
for _ O
its _ O
efficient _ O
, _ O
hassle _ O
free _ O
service _ O
but _ O
also _ O
because _ O
, _ O
we _ O
provide _ O
the _ O
best _ O
possible _ O
connections _ O
, _ O
bringing _ O
India _ O
closer _ O
and _ O
making _ O
travel _ O
accessible _ O
to _ O
everyone _ O
. _ O

Today _ O
, _ O
a _ O
number _ O
of _ O
smaller _ O
towns _ O
such _ O
as _ O
Raipur _ O
, _ O
Gorakhpur _ O
, _ O
and _ O
Tuticorin _ O
have _ O
stood _ O
to _ O
benefit _ O
from _ O
our _ O
network _ O
. _ O

We _ O
now _ O
have _ O
numerous _ O
daily _ O
flights _ O
from _ O
these _ O
places _ O
connecting _ O
them _ O
to _ O
major _ O
cities _ O
and _ O
business _ O
hubs _ O
of _ O
India _ O
. _ O

One _ O
can _ O
only _ O
imagine _ O
the _ O
economic _ O
impact _ O
this _ O
extensive _ O
amount _ O
of _ O
air _ O
access _ O
provides _ O
to _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
of _ O
these _ O
places _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
a _ O
unique _ O
case _ O
of _ O
a _ O
city _ O
whose _ O
citizens _ O
actually _ O
held _ O
a _ O
demonstration _ O
demanding _ O
that _ O
IndiGo _ O
provide _ O
adequate _ O
air _ O
connectivity _ O
to _ O
their _ O
city _ O
( _ O
other _ O
airlines _ O
were _ O
already _ O
flying _ O
to _ O
this _ O
place _ O
) _ O
. _ O

This _ O
level _ O
of _ O
engagement _ O
where _ O
citizens _ O
of _ O
a _ O
city _ O
, _ O
marched _ O
on _ O
the _ O
streets _ O
to _ O
get _ O
IndiGo _ O
to _ O
connect _ O
them _ O
, _ O
is _ O
an _ O
indication _ O
to _ O
us _ O
that _ O
our _ O
regional _ O
expansion _ B-key
plans _ O
are _ O
more _ O
than _ O
justified _ O
. _ O

Where _ O
else _ O
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
do _ O
people _ O
take _ O
out _ O
three _ O
hours _ O
off _ O
their _ O
busy _ O
daily _ O
life _ O
to _ O
demonstrate _ O
for _ O
connectivity _ O
from _ O
an _ O
airline _ O

Many _ O
of _ O
