Dear _ O

Though _ O
one _ O
needs _ O
to _ O
be _ O
circumspect _ O
in _ O
making _ O
defi _ O
nitive _ O
statements _ O
in _ O
an _ O
annual _ B-key
report _ I-key
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
fair _ O
to _ O
say _ O
that _ O
there _ O
are _ O
clear _ O
indicators _ O
of _ O
your _ O
company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
operational _ O
and _ O
fi _ O
nancial _ O
turnaround _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
revenue _ O
side _ O
, _ O
your _ O
company _ O
witnessed _ O
impressive _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
branded _ O
generics _ O
markets _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
Russia _ O
, _ O
China _ O
, _ O
Brazil _ O
and _ O
CIS _ O
countries _ O
. _ O

Other _ O
than _ O
improving _ O
the _ O
base _ O
business _ O
across _ O
these _ O
markets _ O
, _ O
we _ O
launched _ O
several _ O
new _ O
products _ O
and _ O
scaled _ O
up _ O
in _ O
new _ O
geographies _ O
like _ O
Brazil _ O
and _ O
Colombia _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
strong _ O
pricing _ O
pressures _ O
continued _ O
unabated _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
— _ O
your _ O
company _ O

, _ O
and _ O
Dr _ O

Reddy _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
was _ O
no _ O
exception _ O
. _ O

Thankfully _ O
, _ O
strong _ O
revenue _ B-key
growth _ I-key
in _ O
branded _ O

outweighed _ O
the _ O
negative _ O
pull _ O
in _ O
the _ O
US _ O
. _ O

Consequently _ O
, _ O
your _ O
company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
global _ O
generics _ O
revenue _ O
increased _ O
by _ O
8% _ O
over _ O
the _ O
previous _ O

. _ O

In _ O
response _ O
to _ O
the _ O
changing _ O
conditions _ O
in _ O
this _ O
key _ O
market _ O
, _ O
we _ O
are _ O
building _ O
a _ O

In _ O
FY2019 _ O

20 _ O

with _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O

As _ O
on _ O
31 _ O
March _ O

, _ O
your _ O

had _ O
110 _ O

comprising _ O
107 _ O

and _ O

You _ O
will _ O
recall _ O
that _ O
in _ O
our _ O
letter _ O
to _ O
you _ O
last _ O

, _ O
we _ O
had _ O
written _ O
: _ O
“ _ O
From _ O

With _ O

we _ O
believe _ O
that _ O

Regarding _ O
the _ O
API _ O

at _ O
Miryalaguda _ O
, _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
issued _ O

Similarly _ O
, _ O
in _ O

2019 _ O
, _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
issued _ O
an _ O
EIR _ O
for _ O
the _ O

( _ O

. _ O

In _ O
March _ O
2019 _ O
, _ O
we _ O
responded _ O
to _ O
the _ O
follow-up _ O
questions _ O
from _ O
USFDA _ O
regarding _ O
the _ O
API _ O
facility _ O
in _ O
Srikakulam _ O
. _ O

Based _ O
on _ O
the _ O
subsequent _ O
discussion _ O
with _ O

, _ O
we _ O
expect _ O
a _ O
reinspection _ O
will _ O
be _ O
conducted _ O

WHAT _ O
IS _ O
OUR _ O
VIEW _ O

all _ O
players _ O
in _ O

in _ O
the _ O
US _ O

Overcoming _ O
this _ O
necessitates _ O
a _ O
robust _ B-key
pipeline _ I-key
of _ O
complex _ O
formulations _ O
with _ O
limited _ O
competition _ O
— _ O
a _ O
pipeline _ O
that _ O
allows _ O
your _ O
company _ O
to _ O
introduce _ O
several _ O
value-added _ O
products _ O
each _ O
year _ O
, _ O
and _ O
thus _ O
make _ O
up _ O
for _ O
price _ O
erosions _ O
on _ O
the _ O
earlier _ O
launched _ O
products _ O
. _ O

As _ O
touched _ O
upon _ O
earlier _ O
in _ O
this _ O
letter _ O
, _ O
we _ O
have _ O
such _ O
a _ O
pipeline _ O
— _ O
of _ O
110 _ O
generic _ O
fi _ O
lings _ O
awaiting _ O
approval _ O
from _ O
the _ O
USFDA _ O
. _ O

We _ O
have _ O
to _ O
leverage _ O
this _ O
and _ O
ensure _ O
that _ O
we _ O
succeed _ O
in _ O
delivering _ O
these _ O
products _ O
, _ O
molecule _ O

, _ O
to _ O
the _ O

on _ O
the _ O

As _ O
we _ O
