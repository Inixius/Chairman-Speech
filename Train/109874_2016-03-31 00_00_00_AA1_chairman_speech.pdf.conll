MESSAGE _ O
FROM _ O
THE _ O
CHAIRMAN _ O
AND _ O
MANAGING _ O
DIRECTOR _ O
The _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
has _ O
unveiled _ O
a _ O
series _ O
of _ O
policy _ O
initiatives _ O
to _ O
enhance _ O
public _ O
investments _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
infrastructure _ B-key
sector _ I-key
, _ O
especially _ O
roads _ O
, _ O
railways _ O
and _ O
ports _ O
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
context _ O
, _ O
it _ O
would _ O
be _ O
pertinent _ O
to _ O
mention _ O
the _ O
advantages _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
Make _ O
in _ O
India _ O
initiative _ O
. _ O

This _ O
initiative _ O
is _ O
now _ O
acquiring _ O
the _ O
stature _ O
of _ O
a _ O
national _ O
movement _ O
to _ O
promote _ O
manufacturing _ O
expertise _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
in _ O
line _ O
with _ O
global _ O
quality _ O
benchmarks _ O
. _ O

Besides _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
has _ O
also _ O
enhanced _ O
the _ O
ease _ O
of _ O
doing _ O
business _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
attracting _ O
enhanced _ O
foreign _ B-key
capital _ I-key
, _ O
technology _ O
and _ O
human _ O
expertise _ O
. _ O

The _ O
focus _ O
on _ O
Smart _ O
Cities _ O
with _ O
best-in-class _ O
amenities _ O
and _ O
drive _ O
to _ O
enhance _ O
rural _ O
income _ B-key
also _ O
deserve _ O
to _ O
be _ O
mentioned _ O
. _ O

These _ O
trajectories _ O
are _ O
acting _ O
as _ O
a _ O
force _ O
multiplier _ O
for _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
, _ O
and _ O
the _ O
steel _ B-key
sector _ I-key
in _ O
particular _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
India _ O
was _ O
the _ O
only _ O
major _ O
steel _ O
consuming _ O
market _ B-key
globally _ O
, _ O
which _ O
saw _ O
a _ O
demand _ B-key
escalation _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
the _ O
country _ O
suffered _ O
from _ O
an _ O
unprecedented _ O
, _ O
unbridled _ O
and _ O
unfair _ O
inflow _ O
of _ O
steel _ O
imports _ B-key
from _ O
China _ O
, _ O
Japan _ O
, _ O
South _ O
Korea _ O
and _ O
Russia _ O
. _ O

These _ O
countries _ O
continued _ O
to _ O
sell _ O
their _ O
surplus _ O
steel _ O
production _ B-key
at _ O
predatory _ O
prices _ B-key
. _ O

South _ O
Korea _ O
and _ O
Japan _ O
benefited _ O
due _ O
to _ O
the _ O
free _ B-key
trade _ I-key
agreement _ O
with _ O
India _ O
. _ O

The _ O
result _ O
was _ O
that _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
industry _ O
was _ O
forced _ O
to _ O
take _ O
a _ O
series _ O
of _ O
price _ B-key
cuts _ O
, _ O
leading _ O
to _ O
a _ O
severe _ O
margin _ O
squeeze _ O
for _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
companies _ O
. _ O

With _ O
eroding _ O
profitability _ B-key
and _ O
worsening _ O
leverage _ O
ratios _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
stepped _ O
in _ O
and _ O
undertook _ O
necessary _ O
corrective _ O
trade _ B-key
remedial _ O
measures _ O
. _ O

The _ O
objective _ O
was _ O
to _ O
provide _ O
a _ O
level _ O
playing _ O
field _ O
to _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
steel _ O
industry _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Government _ O
enhanced _ O
customs _ O
duty _ O
, _ O
and _ O
introduced _ O
the _ O
minimum _ B-key
import _ I-key
price _ I-key
( _ O
MIP _ B-key
) _ O
mechanism _ O
to _ O
curb _ O
imports _ B-key
at _ O
prices _ B-key
below _ O
marginal _ O
cost _ B-key
of _ O
exporting _ B-key
nations _ O
. _ O

If _ O
not _ O
for _ O
this _ O
timely _ O
intervention _ O
, _ O
the _ O
steel _ O
industry _ O
would _ O
have _ O
been _ O
reeling _ O
under _ O
a _ O
lot _ O
more _ O
pressure _ O
than _ O
currently _ O
. _ O

Among _ O
the _ O
other _ O
measures _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
also _ O
introduced _ O
BIS _ O
standards _ O
for _ O
steel _ O
to _ O
check _ O
sales _ B-key
of _ O
inferior _ O
quality _ O
steel _ O
into _ O
India _ O
. _ O

In _ O
such _ O
a _ O
challenging _ O
operating _ O
environment _ O
, _ O
I _ O
am _ O
happy _ O
to _ O
share _ O
that _ O
team _ O
JSW _ O
Steel _ O
rose _ O
to _ O
the _ O
occasion _ O
and _ O
was _ O
able _ O
to _ O
achieve _ O
a _ O
positive _ O
consolidated _ O
operating _ O
EBITDA _ B-key
of _ O
` _ O
6,073 _ O
crores _ O
. _ O

We _ O
shifted _ O
our _ O
focus _ O
to _ O
the _ O
domestic _ B-key
market _ I-key
, _ O
widening _ O
our _ O
footprint _ O
to _ O
the _ O
markets _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
South _ O
; _ O
we _ O
also _ O
concentrated _ O
on _ O
developing _ O
new _ B-key
markets _ I-key
in _ O
the _ O
East _ O
and _ O
North _ O
East _ O
of _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Additionally _ O
, _ O
we _ O
enriched _ O
our _ O
product _ O
mix _ O
through _ O
development _ O
of _ O
new _ O
and _ O
cutting _ O
edge _ O
steel _ O
grades _ O
, _ O
enhanced _ O
our _ O
quality _ O
benchmarks _ O
and _ O
rationalised _ O
our _ O
cost _ B-key
structure _ O
to _ O
minimise _ O
erosion _ O
of _ O
margins _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
2015 _ O

was _ O
the _ O
sixth _ O
year _ O
of _ O
our _ O
strategic _ B-key
and _ O
technical _ O
collaboration _ O
with _ O
JFE _ O

The _ O
