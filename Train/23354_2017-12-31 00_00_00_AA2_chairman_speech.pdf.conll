s _ O
impetus _ O
in _ O

act _ O
as _ O
a _ O

However _ O
, _ O
we _ O
do _ O
hope _ O
the _ O
government _ O
reviews _ O
and _ O
lowers _ O
the _ O
GST _ O
rate _ O
of _ O
28% _ O
on _ O
cement _ O
which _ O
is _ O
currently _ O
in _ O
the _ O
highest _ O
‘ _ O
luxury _ O
goods _ O
’ _ O
category _ O
whereas _ O
housing _ O
, _ O
and _ O
therefore _ O
cement _ O
, _ O
is _ O
the _ O
basic _ O
requirement _ O
to _ O
fulfil _ O
a _ O
person _ O
’ _ O

fundamental _ O
