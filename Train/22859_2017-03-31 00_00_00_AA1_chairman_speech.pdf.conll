Letter _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ B-key
, _ O
The _ O
one _ O
characteristic _ O
that _ O
has _ O
defined _ O
the _ O
global _ O
economy _ O
over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
decade _ O
or _ O
so _ O
, _ O
is _ O
“ _ O
uncertainty _ O
” _ O
– _ O
uncertainty _ O
that _ O
has _ O
brought _ O
its _ O
share _ O
of _ O
challenges _ O
and _ O
opportunities _ O
. _ O

The _ O
year _ O
2016 _ O
- _ O
17 _ O
had _ O
its _ O
share _ O
of _ O
uncertainty _ O
which _ O
affected _ O
the _ O
performance _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
, _ O
both _ O
domestically _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
in _ O
the _ O
international _ O
markets _ O
where _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
operates _ O
. _ O

Let _ O
me _ O
take _ O
this _ O
opportunity _ O
to _ O
take _ O
you _ O
through _ O
the _ O
key _ O
highlights _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
performance _ O
during _ O
the _ O
financial _ O
year _ O
2016 _ O
- _ O
17 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
single _ O
biggest _ O
event _ O
that _ O
left _ O
its _ O
mark _ O
on _ O
each _ O
and _ O
every _ O
sector _ O
of _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
economy _ O
was _ O
“ _ O
demonetisation _ B-key
” _ O
. _ O

Coming _ O
at _ O
a _ O
time _ O
when _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
was _ O
just _ O
beginning _ O
to _ O
look _ O
up _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Central _ O
Government _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
decision _ O
to _ O
demonetise _ B-key
almost _ O
86% _ O
of _ O
the _ O
currency _ O
notes _ O
in _ O
circulation _ O
, _ O
caused _ O
severe _ B-key
cash _ I-key
shortage _ I-key
in _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
economy _ O
, _ O
which _ O
prefers _ O
cash _ O
as _ O
the _ O
mode _ O
of _ O
payments _ O
, _ O
even _ O
today _ O
. _ O

This _ O
cash _ O
shortage _ O
led _ O
to _ O
a _ O
strain _ O
on _ O
the _ O
consumption _ O
demand _ O
and _ O
business _ O
activity _ O
for _ O
a _ O
greater _ O
part _ O
of _ O
the _ O
second _ O
half _ O
of _ O
the _ O
year _ O

Stressed _ O
loans _ O
plaguing _ O
the _ O
banking _ O
sector _ O
and _ O
the _ O
stretched _ O
corporate _ B-key
balance _ I-key

continued _ O
to _ O
be _ O
a _ O
drag _ O
on _ O
capital _ B-key
investments _ I-key
, _ O
which _ O
have _ O
remained _ O
much _ O
below _ O
the _ O
trends _ O
over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
few _ O
years _ O
. _ O

Low _ O
inflation _ O
and _ O
a _ O
largely _ O
accommodative _ B-key
monetary _ I-key
policy _ I-key
, _ O
though _ O
, _ O
provided _ O
support _ O
in _ O
an _ O
otherwise _ O
difficult _ O
growth _ O
environment _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
global _ O
front _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Brexit _ O
vote _ O
and _ O
the _ O
surprise _ O
election _ O
outcome _ O
in _ O
US _ O
, _ O
further _ O
underlined _ O
the _ O
uncertainty _ O
that _ O
persists _ O
across _ O
the _ O
markets _ O
. _ O

While _ O
such _ O
events _ O
might _ O
appear _ O
to _ O
have _ O
limited _ O
direct _ O
consequences _ O
for _ O
our _ O
domestic _ O
economy _ O
, _ O
the _ O
inter-linkages _ O
of _ O
global _ O

that _ O
no _ O

The _ O
new _ O
financial _ O

has _ O
started _ O
on _ O
an _ O
encouraging _ O
note _ O
with _ O
the _ O

of _ O
the _ O

Tax _ I-key
( _ O
GST _ B-key
) _ O
from _ O
the _ O
second _ O
quarter _ O
of _ O
the _ O
financial _ O
year _ O
. _ O

GST _ B-key
is _ O
being _ O
looked _ O
at _ O
as _ O
the _ O
single _ O
biggest _ O
indirect _ O
tax _ O
reform _ O
and _ O
is _ O
poised _ O
to _ O
push _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
economic _ O
growth _ O
forward _ O
by _ O
creating _ O
a _ O
single _ O
national _ O
market _ O
and _ O
enhancing _ O
the _ O
efficiency _ O
of _ O
inter-state _ O
movement _ O
of _ O
goods _ O

. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
given _ O
the _ O
wide _ B-key
scale _ I-key
of _ I-key
implementation _ I-key
, _ O
it _ O
is _ O
likely _ O
to _ O
cause _ O
some _ O
disruptions _ O
in _ O
the _ O
initial _ O
period _ O
and _ O
the _ O
Company _ O
will _ O
have _ O
to _ O
face _ O
this _ O
hurdle _ O
as _ O
it _ O
adapts _ O
to _ O
this _ O
new _ O
landscape _ O
. _ O

The _ O
initial _ O
forecasts _ O
on _ O
monsoon _ O
are _ O
also _ O
encouraging _ O
and _ O
this _ O
gives _ O
hope _ O
for _ O
a _ O
strong _ O
consumption _ O
demand _ O
from _ O
the _ O
rural _ O
segment _ O
. _ O

On _ O
the _ O
other _ O
hand _ O
, _ O
raw _ O
material _ O
prices _ O
have _ O
moved _ O
up _ O
significantly _ O
over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
few _ O
quarters _ O
putting _ O
pressure _ O
on _ O
margins _ O

In _ O

, _ O
political _ O
stability _ O
in _ O
key _ O
markets _ O
of _ O

be _ O

performance _ O
. _ O

As _ O
we _ O
move _ O

, _ O
the _ O
vagaries _ O

The _ O
