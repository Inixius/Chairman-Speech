Message _ O
from _ O
the _ O
Chairman _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholders _ O
, _ O
Several _ O
path-breaking _ O
reforms _ O
ushered _ O
in _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
over _ O
the _ O
past _ O
few _ O
years _ O
are _ O
gradually _ O
beginning _ O
to _ O
have _ O
a _ O
salutary _ O
impact _ O
on _ O
the _ O
economy _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
and _ O
on _ O
the _ O
Real _ O
Estate _ O
sector _ O
in _ O
particular _ O
. _ O

Even _ O
as _ O
economic _ O
players _ O
are _ O
rapidly _ O
adapting _ O
to _ O
structural _ O
changes _ O
like _ O
GST _ O
, _ O
IBC _ O
and _ O
RERA _ O
, _ O
there _ O
are _ O
signs _ O
of _ O
general _ O
endorsement _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Prime _ O
Minister _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
call _ O
to _ O
Reform _ O
, _ O
Perform _ O
and _ O
Transform _ O
. _ O

Although _ O
, _ O
as _ O
a _ O
nation _ O
in _ O
transition _ O
, _ O
India _ O
still _ O
faces _ O
many _ O
hurdles _ O
on _ O
the _ O
road _ O
to _ O
revival _ O
and _ O
faster _ O
growth _ O
, _ O
the _ O
year _ O
gone _ O
by _ O
has _ O
provided _ O
hopeful _ O
indications _ O
that _ O
the _ O
country _ O
is _ O
moving _ O
in _ O
the _ O
right _ O
direction _ O
. _ O

Added _ O
to _ O
that _ O
is _ O
the _ O
recent _ O
global _ O
recognition _ O
of _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
ranking _ O
as _ O
the _ O
sixth _ O
largest _ O
economy _ B-key
and _ O
as _ O
the _ O
fast-growing _ O
large _ O
economy _ B-key
in _ O
the _ O
world _ O
. _ O

This _ O
has _ O
reinforced _ O
the _ O
belief _ O
that _ O
broadly _ O
speaking _ O
Dr _ O
. _ O

K.P _ O
. _ O

Singh _ O
, _ O
Chairman _ O
macro-economic _ O
fundamentals _ O
have _ O
remained _ O
stable _ O
despite _ O
the _ O
downturn _ O
in _ O
recent _ O
years _ O
. _ O

It _ O
would _ O
be _ O
a _ O
fallacy _ O
however _ O
, _ O
to _ O
become _ O
complacent _ O
on _ O
the _ O
basis _ O
of _ O
the _ O
GDP _ B-key
estimates _ O
of _ O
6.7 _ O
percent _ O
in _ O
2017 _ O
- _ O
18 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
reality _ O
, _ O
as _ O
I _ O
have _ O
often _ O
emphasized _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
, _ O
is _ O
that _ O
India _ O
needs _ O
a _ O
consistent _ O
double-digit _ O
‘ _ O
real _ O
’ _ O
growth _ O
rate _ O
sustained _ O
over _ O
several _ O
years _ O
in _ O
order _ O
to _ O
achieve _ O
the _ O
national _ O
goals _ O
of _ O
inclusive _ O
growth _ O
and _ O
justice _ O
to _ O
all _ O
sections _ O
of _ O
the _ O
vast _ O
population _ O
. _ O

As _ O
I _ O
have _ O
also _ O
repeatedly _ O
advocated _ O
, _ O
the _ O
key _ O
to _ O
transformation _ O
of _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
future _ O
lies _ O
in _ O
recognizing _ O
the _ O
Real _ O
Estate _ O
sector _ O
as _ O
the _ O
principle _ O
engine _ O
of _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

The _ O
housing _ B-key
and _ I-key
construction _ I-key
sector _ I-key
has _ O
a _ O
multiplier _ O
effect _ O
on _ O
the _ O
entire _ O
economy _ B-key
- _ O
it _ O
is _ O
the _ O
fourth _ O
largest _ O
employment _ O
generator _ O
and _ O
is _ O
a _ O
significant _ O
contributor _ O
to _ O
GDP _ B-key
, _ O
with _ O
studies _ O
showing _ O
that _ O
construction _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
, _ O
accounts _ O
for _ O
11.39 _ O
percent _ O
of _ O
the _ O
total _ O
economic _ O
output _ O
. _ O

Moreover _ O
, _ O
every _ O
rupee _ O
invested _ O
in _ O
the _ O
housing _ B-key
sector _ I-key
results _ O
in _ O
an _ O
addition _ O
5 _ O
of _ O
` _ O
1.54 _ O
to _ O
GDP _ O
and _ O
, _ O
if _ O
household _ O
expenditure _ O
is _ O
also _ O
taken _ O
into _ O
consideration _ O
, _ O
the _ O
contribution _ O
adds _ O
up _ O
to _ O
` _ O
2.84 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
Government _ O
has _ O
brought _ O
forward _ O
several _ O
important _ O
reforms _ O
, _ O
the _ O
most _ O
significant _ O
being _ O
the _ O
Real _ O
Estate _ O
( _ O
Regulation _ O
and _ O
Development _ O
) _ O
Act _ O
, _ O
2016 _ O
( _ O
RERA _ O
) _ O
. _ O

This _ O
shall _ O
undoubtedly _ O
boost _ O
consumer _ O
confidence _ O
and _ O
pave _ O
the _ O
way _ O
for _ O
accelerated _ O
demand _ O
for _ O
housing _ O
products _ O
and _ O
facilitate _ O
flow _ O
of _ O
investments _ B-key
into _ O
the _ O
real _ O
estate _ O
sector _ O
, _ O
both _ O
from _ O
global _ O
and _ O
Indian _ O
investors _ O
. _ O

Implementation _ O
of _ O
RERA _ O
shall _ O
also _ O
streamline _ O
norms _ O
for _ O
transparency _ O
and _ O
accountability _ O
and _ O

compliance _ O
mechanism _ O
for _ O
timely _ O
delivery _ O
of _ O
good _ O
quality _ O
housing _ O
projects _ O
. _ O

RERA _ O
has _ O
been _ O
well _ O
supported _ O
by _ O
the _ O

of _ O

Real _ O

, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
recent _ O
months _ O

has _ O
also _ O
received _ O
