Letter _ O
Dear _ O
Shareholder _ O
, _ O
As _ O
you _ O
know _ O
, _ O
I _ O
am _ O
neither _ O
a _ O
soothsayer _ O
nor _ O
its _ O
modern _ O
day _ O
avatar _ O
, _ O
an _ O
economist _ O
. _ O

Thus _ O
, _ O
I _ O
find _ O
it _ O
difficult _ O
to _ O
predict _ O
what _ O
a _ O
country _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
will _ O
be _ O
like _ O
until _ O
the _ O
numbers _ O
are _ O
published _ O
and _ O
become _ O
known _ O
to _ O
all _ O
. _ O

Even _ O
so _ O
, _ O
I _ O
had _ O
somehow _ O
expected _ O
that _ O
we _ O
might _ O
cross _ O
7% _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
. _ O

The _ O
citizens _ O
of _ O
the _ O
country _ O
certainly _ O
deserved _ O
it _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
it _ O
looks _ O
as _ O
if _ O
I _ O
will _ O
be _ O
disappointed _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
advance _ O
estimate _ O
of _ O
national _ O
income _ O
released _ O
on _ O
28 _ O
February _ O
2018 _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Central _ O
Statistical _ O
Organisation _ O
of _ O
the _ O
Government _ O
of _ O
India _ O
has _ O
pegged _ O
India _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
real _ O
GDP _ O
growth _ O
for _ O
2017 _ O
- _ O
18 _ O
( _ O
FY2018 _ O
) _ O
at _ O
6.6% _ O
. _ O

If _ O
this _ O
is _ O
what _ O
we _ O
actually _ O
end _ O
up _ O
with _ O
, _ O
it _ O
will _ O
represent _ O
a _ O
deceleration _ O
of _ O
50 _ O
basis _ O
points _ O
compared _ O
to _ O
7.1% _ O
achieved _ O
in _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
gross _ O
value _ O
added _ O
( _ O
GVA _ O
) _ O
estimates _ O
show _ O
a _ O
similar _ O
trend _ O
. _ O

Real _ O
GVA _ O
growth _ O
for _ O
FY2018 _ O
has _ O
been _ O
estimated _ O
at _ O
6.4% _ O
versus _ O
7.1% _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

I _ O
can _ O
think _ O
of _ O
many _ O
reasons _ O
why _ O
we _ O
may _ O
end _ O
up _ O
performing _ O
worse _ O
than _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

Of _ O
these _ O
, _ O
two _ O
are _ O
particularly _ O
important _ O
. _ O

The _ O
first _ O
is _ O
insufficient _ O
investments _ O
. _ O

Our _ O
share _ O
of _ O
gross _ O
fixed _ O
capital _ O
formation _ O
to _ O
GDP _ O
has _ O
been _ O
declining _ O
over _ O
the _ O
last _ O
six _ O
years _ O
and _ O
now _ O
stands _ O
at _ O
31% _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
insufficient _ O
to _ O
bring _ O
about _ O
a _ O
steady-state _ O
growth _ O
of _ O
7.5% _ O
to _ O
8% _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
is _ O
the _ O
terrible _ O
state _ O
of _ O
our _ O
banks _ O
. _ O

Saddled _ O
by _ O
a _ O
huge _ O
overhang _ O
of _ O
bad _ O
loans _ O
or _ O
non-performing _ O
assets _ O
that _ O
have _ O
eroded _ O
their _ O
balance _ O
sheets _ O
and _ O
destroyed _ O
profits _ O
, _ O
most _ O
banks _ O
have _ O
neither _ O
the _ O
requisite _ O
financial _ O
strength _ O
nor _ O
the _ O
confidence _ O
to _ O
fund _ O
industrial _ O
growth _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
not _ O
only _ O
affecting _ O
the _ O
bigger _ O
players _ O
but _ O
, _ O
much _ O
more _ O
so _ O
, _ O
the _ O
medium _ O
and _ O
smaller _ O
scale _ O
corporate _ O
entities _ O
across _ O
India _ O
who _ O
are _ O
now _ O
hardpressed _ O
to _ O
secure _ O
necessary _ O
working _ O
capital _ O
let _ O
aside _ O
term _ O
loans _ O
for _ O
investments _ O
. _ O

Despite _ O
the _ O
benefits _ O
that _ O
ought _ O
to _ O
accrue _ O
from _ O
the _ O
new _ O
bankruptcy _ O
process _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
I _ O
do _ O
not _ O
see _ O
a _ O
quick _ O
resolution _ O
to _ O
this _ O
problem _ O
. _ O

In _ O
this _ O
somewhat _ O
unhappy _ O
macro _ O
context _ O
, _ O
I _ O
am _ O
pleased _ O
that _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
has _ O
performed _ O
creditably _ O
. _ O

are _ O
the _ O
key _ O
results _ O
for _ O
FY2018 _ O

Let _ O
me _ O
share _ O
with _ O
you _ O
two _ O
positive _ O
aspects _ O
of _ O
the _ O
FY2018 _ O
growth _ O
story _ O
. _ O

The _ O
first _ O
has _ O
to _ O
do _ O
with _ O
exports _ O
. _ O

During _ O
the _ O
year _ O
, _ O
motorcycle _ O
exports _ O
grew _ O
by _ O
14.5% _ O
and _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
sold _ O
1.39 _ O
million _ O

to _ O
customers _ O
abroad _ O
— _ O
thanks _ O
to _ O
concentrated _ O
efforts _ O
by _ O
the _ O
Management _ O
plus _ O
strong _ O
growth _ O
in _ O
Africa _ O
led _ O
by _ O
economic _ O
recovery _ O
in _ O
Nigeria _ O
, _ O
in _ O
the _ O
ASEAN _ O
owing _ O
to _ O
product _ O
launches _ O
in _ O
Philippines _ O
and _ O
entry _ O
into _ O
Malaysia _ O
, _ O
and _ O
in _ O
Latin _ O
America _ O
, _ O
especially _ O
in _ O
new _ O
countries _ O
such _ O
as _ O
Argentina _ O
. _ O

Commercial _ O
vehicle _ O
exports _ O
increased _ O
by _ O
39% _ O
to _ O
over _ O
267,000 _ O
units _ O
, _ O
led _ O
by _ O
a _ O
recovery _ O
in _ O
Egypt _ O
and _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
sustained _ O
investments _ O
in _ O
other _ O
markets _ O
. _ O

In _ O
FY2018 _ O
, _ O
exports _ O
fetched _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
and _ O
the _ O
country _ O
US _ O
$1.36 _ O
billion _ O
in _ O
revenues _ O
— _ O
up _ O
by _ O
over _ O
25% _ O
compared _ O
to _ O
the _ O
previous _ O
year _ O
. _ O

The _ O
second _ O
good _ O
news _ O
relates _ O
to _ O
three-wheelers _ O
. _ O

Last _ O
year _ O
, _ O
this _ O
segment _ O
faced _ O
a _ O
severe _ O
demand _ O
crunch _ O
. _ O

That _ O
is _ O
a _ O
thing _ O
of _ O
the _ O
past _ O
. _ O

In _ O
FY2018 _ O
, _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
domestic _ O
three-wheeler _ O
sales _ O
broke _ O
records _ O
to _ O
reach _ O
an _ O
all-time _ O
high _ O
of _ O
369,637 _ O
units _ O
, _ O
representing _ O
a _ O
volume _ O
growth _ B-key
of _ O
46% _ O
over _ O
FY2017 _ O
. _ O

Consequently _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
market _ O
share _ O
in _ O
the _ O
domestic _ O
three-wheeler _ O
segment _ O
has _ O
shot _ O
up _ O
in _ O
the _ O
course _ O
of _ O
a _ O
single _ O
year _ O
from _ O
49.5% _ O
in _ O
FY2017 _ O
to _ O
58.1% _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
. _ O

For _ O
passenger _ O
carriers _ O
, _ O
the _ O
market _ O
share _ O
is _ O
higher _ O
still _ O
: _ O
up _ O
from _ O
59.7% _ O
last _ O
year _ O

67.0% _ O

Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
Limited _ O
I _ O
am _ O
particularly _ O
pleased _ O
with _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
performance _ O
in _ O
the _ O
goods _ O
carrier _ O
business _ O
, _ O
which _ O
it _ O
had _ O
entered _ O
just _ O
two _ O
years _ O
ago _ O
. _ O

In _ O
a _ O
short _ O
span _ O
of _ O
time _ O
, _ O
it _ O
has _ O
ramped _ O
up _ O
goods _ O
carrier _ O
sales _ O
from _ O
1,325 _ O
units _ O
in _ O
FY2016 _ O
to _ O
22,791 _ O
units _ O
in _ O
FY2018 _ O
, _ O
and _ O
now _ O
accounts _ O
for _ O
over _ O
19% _ O
market _ O
share _ O
of _ O
this _ O
segment _ O
in _ O
India _ O
. _ O

Your _ O
Company _ O
could _ O
have _ O
done _ O
even _ O
better _ O
had _ O
it _ O
not _ O
been _ O
affected _ O
by _ O
a _ O
decline _ O
in _ O
domestic _ O
motorcycle _ O
sales _ O
. _ O

This _ O
was _ O
not _ O
on _ O
account _ O
of _ O
the _ O
market _ O
as _ O
a _ O
whole _ O
nor _ O
due _ O
to _ O
an _ O
overall _ O
lack _ O
of _ O
demand _ O
for _ O
all _ O
types _ O
and _ O
makes _ O
of _ O
motorcycles _ O
. _ O

Indeed _ O
, _ O
FY2018 _ O
saw _ O
domestic _ O
sales _ O
of _ O
motorcycles _ O
grow _ O
by _ O
13.7% _ O
by _ O
volume _ O
. _ O

Your _ O
Company _ O
continued _ O
doing _ O
well _ O
at _ O
the _ O
entry-level _ O
segment _ O
with _ O
its _ O
CT _ O
100 _ O
, _ O
Platina _ O
and _ O
Discover _ O
100 _ O
/ _ O
110 _ O
, _ O
as _ O
well _ O
as _ O
in _ O
the _ O
sports _ O
and _ O
‘ _ O
super-sports _ O
’ _ O
segments _ O
with _ O
its _ O
Pulsars _ O
, _ O
Avengers _ O
, _ O
the _ O
Dominar _ O
400 _ O
and _ O
the _ O
KTMs _ O
. _ O

However _ O
, _ O
it _ O
could _ O
not _ O
perform _ O
adequately _ O
in _ O
the _ O
large _ O
‘ _ O
commuter _ O
’ _ O
segment _ O
and _ O
sold _ O
less _ O
than _ O
what _ O
was _ O
expected _ O
. _ O

Hopefully _ O
, _ O
this _ O
gap _ O
will _ O
be _ O
taken _ O
care _ O
of _ O
in _ O
the _ O
next _ O
couple _ O
of _ O
years _ O
through _ O
existing _ O
and _ O
new _ O
products _ O
. _ O

This _ O
is _ O
a _ O
critical _ O
segment _ O
and _ O
, _ O
as _ O
I _ O
understand _ O
, _ O
your _ O
Managing _ O
Director _ O
and _ O
his _ O
team _ O
are _ O
expending _ O
considerable _ O
effort _ O
at _ O
bridging _ O
this _ O
gap _ O
. _ O

I _ O
wish _ O
them _ O
well _ O
and _ O
hope _ O
that _ O
they _ O
will _ O
overcome _ O
this _ O
challenge _ O
, _ O
as _ O
they _ O
have _ O
others _ O
in _ O
the _ O
past _ O
. _ O

Last _ O
year _ O
I _ O
had _ O
written _ O
, _ O
“ _ O
Bajaj _ O
Auto _ O
is _ O
a _ O
sound _ O
and _ O
profitable _ O
company _ O
. _ O

What _ O
we _ O
need _ O
is _ O
a _ O
year _ O
’ _ O
s _ O
uptick _ O
to _ O
take _ O
us _ O
on _ O
to _ O
a _ O
new _ O
growth _ O
trajectory _ O
. _ O

May _ O
that _ O
be _ O
FY2018 _ O
. _ O
” _ O

That _ O
uptick _ O
has _ O
hopefully _ O
begun _ O
. _ O

Now _ O
is _ O
the _ O
time _ O
to _ O
drive _ O
motorcycle _ O
sales _ O
, _ O
introduce _ O
the _ O
quadricycle _ O
in _ O
India _ O
, _ O
further _ O
grow _ O
the _ O
three-wheeler _ O
and _ O
export _ O
businesses _ O
and _ O
take _ O
your _ O
Company _ O
to _ O
new _ O
heights _ O
. _ O

Please _ O
join _ O
me _ O
in _ O
asking _ O
your _ O
Managing _ O
Director _ O
and _ O
the _ O
Management _ O
to _ O
relentlessly _ O
aim _ O
higher _ O

Because _ O
we _ O
deserve _ O
the _ O
best _ O
… _ O
and _ O
when _ O
that _ O
is _ O
achieved _ O

do _ O
even _ O
better _ O
